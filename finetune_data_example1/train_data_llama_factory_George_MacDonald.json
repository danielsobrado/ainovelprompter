It was a structure of splendor and magnificence, a fitting abode for royalty. Born within these regal walls was Princess Irene, a child of delicate beginnings. Shortly after her arrival into the world, Irene, whose mother's health was frail, was entrusted to the pastoral care of villagers. They dwelled in a stately dwelling, a hybrid of castle and country home, nestled midway up the slope of a neighboring mountain.\\n",

    "output": "There was once a little princess whose father was king over a great country full of mountains and valleys. His palace was built upon one of the mountains, and was very grand and beautiful. The princess, whose name was Irene, was born there, but she was sent soon after her birth, because her mother was not very strong, to be brought up by country people in a large house, half castle, half farmhouse, on the side of another mountain, about half-way between its base and its peak."

As my narrative unfolds, she was about eight years old, rapidly approaching the cusp of maturity. Her visage radiated beauty, framed by a pair of eyes that mirrored the nocturnal heavens\u2014dark and deep, each flecked with a solitary, shimmering star. These celestial eyes seemed almost aware of their origin, frequently gazing skyward. Above her, the nursery ceiling was painted a stellar blue, dotted with artificial stars striving to mimic the celestial dome. Yet, despite this crafted canopy, it is doubtful that Princess Irene ever truly witnessed the natural splendor of a starry sky, a fact tied to a crucial reason that merits immediate disclosure.\\n",

Her face was fair and pretty, with eyes like two bits of night sky, each with a star dissolved in the blue. Those eyes you would have thought must have known they came from there, so often were they turned up in that direction. The ceiling of her nursery was blue, with stars in it, as like the sky as they could make it. But I doubt if ever she saw the real sky with the stars in it, for a reason which I had better mention at once."

These subterranean marvels might have remained largely unexplored, were it not for the mines etched deep within the mountain's heart. Miners, in pursuit of the rich ores cradled in the rock, carved extensive galleries and tunnels. During their excavations, they frequently breached these natural chambers.

Legends whispered that they once lived among the surface dwellers, indistinguishable from other folk. However, driven underground by oppressive taxes, stringent laws, or harsh treatment from the king, they vanished from above ground society. Opting not to flee to foreign lands, they sought sanctuary in the labyrinthine caves below, emerging only under the veil of night. Rarely seen, these creatures congregated in the most secluded mountainous areas, seldom revealing themselves. Those who glimpsed them spoke of their transformation over generations into figures of either grotesque horror or bizarre whimsy, far surpassing any wild fantasy depicted in art or literature. Yet, some speculated these witnesses might have confused the goblins' animal allies for the goblins themselves. Despite their grotesque forms, the goblins retained a semblance of humanity, gaining in cunning and intelligence what they lost in beauty. Mischievously inclined, they delighted in vexing the surface dwellers, particularly the descendants of the king responsible for their plight. Over time, the goblins established their own monarchy and government, focused largely on crafting nuisances for their aboveground neighbors. This explains why Princess Irene, growing up amidst such threats, never witnessed the starlit sky\u2014her guardians, wary of goblin mischief, kept her safely indoors during the night.\\n",
    "input": "",
    "output": "Now in these subterranean caverns lived a strange race of beings, called by some gnomes, by some kobolds, by some goblins. There was a legend current in the country that at one time they lived above ground, and were very like other people. But for some reason or other, concerning which there were different legendary theories, the king had laid what they thought too severe taxes upon them, or had required observances of them they did not like, or had begun to treat them with more severity, in some way or other, and impose stricter laws; and the consequence was that they had all disappeared from the face of the country. According to the legend, however, instead of going to some other country, they had all taken refuge in the subterranean caverns, whence they never came out but at night, and then seldom showed themselves in any numbers, and never to many people at once. It was only in the least frequented and most difficult parts of the mountains that they were said to gather even at night in the open air. Those who had caught sight of any of them said that they had greatly altered in the course of generations; and no wonder, seeing they lived away from the sun, in cold and wet and dark places. They were now, not ordinarily ugly, but either absolutely hideous, or ludicrously grotesque both in face and form. There was no invention, they said, of the most lawless imagination expressed by pen or pencil, that could surpass the extravagance of their appearance. But I suspect those who said so had mistaken some of their animal companions for the goblins themselves--of which more by and by. The goblins themselves were not so far removed from the human as such a description would imply. And as they grew misshapen in body they had grown in knowledge and cleverness, and now were able to do things no mortal could see the possibility of. But as they grew in cunning, they grew in mischief, and their great delight was in every way they could think of to annoy the people who lived in the open-air storey above them. They had enough of affection left for each other to preserve them from being absolutely cruel for cruelty's sake to those that came in their way; but still they so heartily cherished the ancestral grudge against those who occupied their former possessions and especially against the descendants of the king who had caused their expulsion, that they sought every opportunity of tormenting them in ways that were as odd as their inventors; and although dwarfed and misshapen, they had strength equal to their cunning. In the process of time they had got a king and a government of their own, whose chief business, beyond their own simple affairs, was to devise trouble for their neighbours. It will now be pretty evident why the little princess had never seen the sky at night. They were much too afraid of the goblins to let her out of the house then, even in company with ever so many attendants; and they had good reason, as we shall see by and by."

Putting down his pickaxe, he retrieved a piece of bread he had stored in a damp crevice earlier, sat down on a pile of ore, and enjoyed his meal. Taking a brief rest, he reclined against the rock for a few minutes. However, his relaxation was short-lived as he suddenly caught a peculiar sound emanating from within the rock itself.

Towards midnight he began to feel rather hungry; so he dropped his pickaxe, got out a lump of bread which in the morning he had laid in a damp hole in the rock, sat down on a heap of ore, and ate his supper. Then he leaned back for five minutes' rest before beginning his work again, and laid his head against the rock. He had not kept the position for one minute before he heard something which made him sharpen his ears. It sounded like a voice inside the rock. After a while he heard it again.

While the miners' section had been isolated from the goblins' domain, they hadn't been vulnerable to such attacks. However, with a passage now breached and the goblins' domain situated higher in the mountain, Curdie realized the mine could be submerged in a matter of hours. Water was always the miners' primary hazard, although they occasionally encountered choke-damp, but never the explosive firedamp prevalent in coal mines. Therefore, they were vigilant at the slightest hint of water. Reflecting on this while the goblins were preoccupied, Curdie concluded that it was best to seal off the entire passage, filling it with stone, clay, or mud to prevent any water ingress. Although there was no immediate peril, as the goblins' plan hinged on the failure of another undisclosed design, Curdie was eager to maintain communication to uncover the primary plan.

Water was always the chief danger to which the miners were exposed. They met with a little choke-damp sometimes, but never with the explosive firedamp so common in coal-mines. Hence they were careful as soon as they saw any appearance of water. As the result of his reflections while the goblins were busy in their old home, it seemed to Curdie that it would be best to build up the whole of this gang, filling it with stone, and clay or lie, so that there should be no smallest channel for the water to get into. There was not, however, any immediate danger, for the execution of the goblins' plan was contingent upon the failure of that unknown design which was to take precedence of it; and he was most anxious to keep the door of communication open, that he might if possible discover what the former plan was. At the same time they could not resume their intermitted labours for the inundation without his finding it out; when by putting all hands to the work, the one existing outlet might in a single night be rendered impenetrable to any weight of water; for by filling the gang entirely up, their embankment would be buttressed by the sides of the mountain itself."

'You see, she hasn't extended an invitation to me, and distinguished elderly ladies like her prefer visitors to seek permission before arriving.' The garden was truly enchanting. Situated on the mountainside, it featured rocky outcrops scattered throughout, lending a rugged charm to the landscape. Clusters of heather and other hardy mountain flora adorned these rocks, while nearby, more delicate roses, lilies, and other garden blooms flourished. This harmonious blend of untamed mountain terrain and cultivated garden was both charming and unconventional, defying any attempts to impose a formal or rigid structure upon its natural beauty.\\n",

    "output": "'Come, my child; we'll have a walk in the garden together,' he said. 'You won't come up and see my huge, great, beautiful grandmother, then, king-papa?' said the princess. 'Not this time,' said the king very gently. 'She has not invited me, you know, and great old ladies like her do not choose to be visited without leave asked and given.' The garden was a very lovely place. Being upon a mountainside there were parts in it where the rocks came through in great masses, and all immediately about them remained quite wild. Tufts of heather grew upon them, and other hardy mountain plants and flowers, while near them would be lovely roses and lilies and all pleasant garden flowers. This mingling of the wild mountain with the civilized garden was very quaint, and it was impossible for any number of gardeners to make such a garden look formal and stiff."

There, they engaged in a heartfelt conversation on various topics. Eventually, the king remarked, 'You were out quite late one evening, Irene.' 'Yes, Papa. It was my fault, and Lootie felt very remorseful.' 'I'll have a word with Lootie about it,' the king decided. 'Please, Papa, be gentle with her,' Irene pleaded.

Unfortunately, the princess missed much of the starlit skies as she retired early. Winter approached, and she found herself growing weary. On stormy days when venturing outside was impossible and her toys ceased to entertain, Lootie would lead her around the house. Sometimes they visited the housekeeper, a kind soul who treated her like family. Other times, they ventured into the servants' hall or the kitchen, where she ruled as queen and risked being spoiled.

When it was too stormy to go out, and she had got tired of her toys, Lootie would take her about the house, sometimes to the housekeeper's room, where the housekeeper, who was a good, kind old woman, made much of her--sometimes to the servants' hall or the kitchen, where she was not princess merely, but absolute queen, and ran a great risk of being spoiled. Sometimes she would run off herself to the room where the men-at-arms whom the king had left sat, and they showed her their arms and accoutrements and did what they could to amuse her. Still at times she found it very dreary, and often and often wished that her huge great grandmother had not been a dream."
