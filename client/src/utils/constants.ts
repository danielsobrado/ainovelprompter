    prompt: `Task: Fix AI Writing Tropes in Text

Core AI Tropes to Eliminate:
1. Eye-based emotional indicators:
   - "eyes gleamed/sparkled/narrowed/softened"
   - "something in their eyes"
   - "eyes took on a [adjective] look"
   
2. Vague emotional descriptions:
   - "expression softened/hardened"
   - "felt a surge of [emotion]"
   - "couldn't help but [action]"
   
3. Mechanical thought indicators:
   - "gears turning"
   - "mind raced"
   - "thoughts swirled"
   
4. Filter words and unnecessary narration:
   - "could see/feel/hear"
   - "seemed to"
   - "appeared to be"
   
5. Overused transitions:
   - "after a long moment"
   - "fell silent"
   - "let out a breath they didn't know they were holding"

Replacement Strategies:
- Use specific physical actions instead of internal states
- Show emotion through dialogue and behavior, not description
- Cut filter words - just state what happens
- Replace clich√©s with fresh, specific details
