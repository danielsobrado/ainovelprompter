Here are some ways this fantasy text could be enhanced to align with the standards of commercial fantasy novels:
Character Development:

Provide more details about who Varian and Elric are, their backgrounds, motivations, and relationship to each other. Help the reader connect to them emotionally.
Show the characters' thoughts, feelings and reactions to the situation and environment to bring them to life.

World-building:

While the stormy night setting is evocative, more specifics could be added about the fantasy world - What is unique about it? Are there magical elements?
Mention a few telling details about the outpost they are headed to, to make the world feel real and intriguing.

Pacing & Narrative Structure:

This opening sets a mood but the pace is a bit slow. Provide a stronger hook - perhaps hint at their urgent mission or quest.
Give a clearer sense of where this scene fits into the overall narrative arc. Is this the beginning of their journey or are they nearing the end?

Prose & Readability:

The prose is clear and readable but could be more vivid. Use sensory details to immerse the reader in the scene. What does the rain and wind feel/sound like?
Vary sentence structure and length. The repeated "They were... having..." makes it feel repetitive.
Avoid cliches like "It was a dark and stormy night" which can make the writing feel generic rather than fresh.

Themes & Tone:

Common fantasy motifs of a long journey/quest and companions are hinted at. Consider how to put a unique spin on these.
The ominous tone is set well with the storm and darkness. Maintain this consistency as the story unfolds.
Make sure the characters' voices are distinct from each other and from the narrative voice to enhance reader engagement.

Positive:

Creates an atmospheric, moody setting
Clear, readable prose
Hints at an epic quest narrative

Negative:

Lacks a strong opening hook
Needs more specific world-building details
Characters are underdeveloped so far

Overall, while this opening sets the scene, it could be enhanced by providing more specificity, strengthening the hook, and beginning to develop the characters and world in unique ways. With some refinement, it could draw readers into an immersive fantasy story. The key is to go beyond generic elements and infuse the story with vivid details to make it stand out in the genre.
