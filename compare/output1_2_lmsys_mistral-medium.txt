Varian and Elric trudged towards the outpost, their faces etched with exhaustion and concern. They had heard the news from the riders - goblins killing cows in the frontier villages, leaving the carcasses behind. It was unsettling.

Varian reported the recent incident in the village where a girl had been attacked, but no attacker was found. Captain Aldric, a seasoned man with a stern gaze, realized the gravity of the situation and ordered increased patrols and a thorough search of the borders.

Varian and Elric exchanged worried glances. The outpost was already short-handed. Aldric, noticing their concern, decided to recruit men from the village. He warned them sternly, "Do not enter goblin territory. Your job is to watch and guard."

Varian and Elric checked the outpost's defenses, ensuring every nook and cranny was secure. They gathered a dozen men from the village, assigning them to four-hour shifts with experienced guards. An uneasy calm settled over the outpost as patrols began.

Varian, a man of deep faith, shared his belief about the evil that dwelled in the forest. Elric, more pragmatic, listened quietly, his eyes scanning the trees for any signs of movement. During their watch, they spotted something moving in the shadows. Hearts pounding, they prepared for the worst, only to find a scared rabbit darting away.

The night was long and restless. Varian and Elric struggled to sleep, haunted by memories and a sense of impending danger. The next morning, a patrol returned with news of goblin tracks along the border. It was a scouting party.

Elric ordered the men to sharpen their weapons and remain vigilant. Varian pondered on the bravery or foolishness of the farmers who lived near the evil forest. He feared that a great evil was stirring in goblin territory. Elric, sensing his friend's worry, reassured him, "We will stand against whatever threat emerges from the trees."

An atmosphere of nervous energy and anticipation filled the outpost. The men prepared for the impending goblin attack, their faces a mix of determination and fear. Varian, looking at them, felt a surge of responsibility. He would not let them down. The forest may be dark and foreboding, but they would not back down. They were the first line of defense against the evil that lurked within.

Captain Aldric paced around the outpost, his gaze sharp and alert. He knew they were in for a tough fight. But he also knew that his men, under Varian and Elric's leadership, were ready. As the sun began to set, casting long shadows across the forest, the outpost braced itself for the night ahead. The goblins were coming, and they would be ready.

Varian looked at the men around him, their faces illuminated by the flickering torchlight. He felt a sense of pride and determination. They would not let fear control them. They would stand together and face whatever came their way. The forest may be dark and full of evil, but they would not back down. They were the outpost, the first line of defense against the goblins. And they would not fail.

As the night wore on, the tension in the outpost grew. Every rustle in the bushes, every snap of a twig, sent a jolt of fear through the men. But Varian and Elric remained calm, their eyes scanning the forest for any signs of movement. They knew that the goblins were out there, watching and waiting. But they would not give in to fear. They would stand their ground and protect their home.

Hours passed, and the moon began to rise, casting a silvery glow over the forest. Suddenly, they heard it - the sound of goblin drums in the distance. The men tensed, their grips tightening on their weapons. Varian looked at Elric, his eyes filled with determination. They were ready. The battle for the outpost was about to begin.

The goblins emerged from the forest, their eyes glowing red in the darkness. They charged towards the outpost, their weapons raised. Varian and Elric led the charge, their swords flashing in the moonlight. The battle was fierce, the sound of clashing steel echoing through the forest. But the men of the
