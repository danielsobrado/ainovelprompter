The sun dipped below the horizon, casting the outpost into an uneasy twilight. Varian and Elric trudged along the worn path, their boots crunching against the gravel. The weight of their weapons and the recent events hung heavily on their shoulders.

"Three cows slain," Varian murmured, his voice barely audible. "And no sign of the attackers."

Elric nodded, his eyes scanning the dense foliage surrounding them. "Aye. And the girl in the village... no one saw a thing."

They arrived at the outpost, a sturdy wooden fortification nestled against the edge of the forest. Varian reported the incident to Captain Aldric, a grizzled veteran with a stern gaze.

"Goblins," Aldric growled, his hands clenched into fists. "They've been raiding the frontier villages. Killing livestock, but not taking the bodies."

Varian's heart sank. Goblins were a nuisance, but this new behavior was unsettling. Aldric ordered increased patrols and a thorough search of the borders.

"We're short-handed," Varian said, concern etched on his face.

Elric nodded in agreement. "We need more men."

Aldric rubbed his beard, deep in thought. "Recruit from the village. We need every able-bodied man we can get."

Varian and Elric left the captain's quarters, their minds racing with the weight of their new responsibilities.

"Be cautious," Aldric warned. "Don't enter goblin territory. Watch and guard."

The pair spent the rest of the day preparing the outpost's defenses. Varian organized the new recruits, assigning them to four-hour shifts with experienced guards.

As night fell, an uneasy calm settled over the outpost. The men patrolled the perimeter, their eyes peeled for any sign of movement in the shadows.

During their watch, Varian and Elric spotted a movement in the trees. They tensed, their hands tightening around their weapons. But as they approached, they found only a scared rabbit.

Varian couldn't shake the feeling of unease. The forest seemed darker, more foreboding than ever.

"I believe evil lives in those trees," he said, his voice barely above a whisper.

Elric nodded, his gaze fixed on the treeline. "We'll stand against whatever comes our way."

The night wore on, the tension never easing. Neither man could sleep, haunted by memories and the sense of impending danger.

The next morning, a patrol returned with grim news. Goblin tracks had been found along the border, indicating a scouting party.

"We're in for a fight," Elric said, his voice steady.

Varian nodded, his resolve firm. "We'll be ready."

The men sharpened their weapons, their conversations hushed and serious. The outpost buzzed with nervous energy, anticipation hanging heavy in the air.

Varian looked out at the forest, his heart heavy. He thought of the farmers who lived near the evil forest, their bravery or foolishness unknown. He feared that a great evil was stirring in goblin territory.

But they would stand firm, ready to face whatever lurked in the shadows.

And so, the outpost waited, the men preparing for the impending goblin attack. The air was thick with tension, the forest a silent, ominous presence. The stage was set for a battle, the outcome uncertain. But Varian and Elric, along with their fellow guards, were ready to defend their home, no matter the cost.
