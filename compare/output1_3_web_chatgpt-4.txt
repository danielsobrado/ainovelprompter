As Varian and Elric trudged toward the outpost, their boots scuffed the dusty trail, each step a testament to the weight of their recent encounters. "Did you hear?" Elric broke the silence, his voice carrying a mix of weariness and concern. "Riders from the east brought news—three cows slain, no bodies taken."

Varian nodded, his brow furrowed. "Same as in Weston village. There, a girl nearly met the same fate. Attacked out of nowhere, and yet, no one saw a thing." The memory darkened his expression, eyes scanning the horizon as if expecting shadows to spring to life.

At the outpost, they were greeted by the stern face of Captain Aldric, a man whose presence seemed carved from the very stones of the fort. "Report," he commanded, more than asked, his voice a hard echo against the walls.

Elric relayed the grim news, while Varian spoke of Weston. Aldric's hand tightened around his worn hilt. "This is no ordinary mischief," he concluded, voice grim. "Double the patrols. I want eyes on every thicket, every shadow."

"But, Captain, we're short-handed as it is," Varian pointed out, concern etching deeper lines into his already weathered face.

Aldric's gaze swept over the two of them, resolute. "Then we'll make do. We’ll pull men from the village. They’re sturdy folk; they can hold a spear well enough in a pinch."

He gave a directive that was as much a warning as it was an order. "Stay clear of goblin lands. Watch, guard, but do not engage."

After the meeting, Varian and Elric took to bolstering the outpost’s defenses. With a dozen village men rallied to their cause, they set about assigning shifts. "Four hours each," Varian instructed, pairing the green recruits with the outpost's seasoned guards. "Keep sharp, stay alive."

As night draped over the outpost, a tense silence fell. Huddled by a small fire, Varian and Elric shared whispered stories of old—tales of goblin rituals and dark enchantments. "They say evil dwells deep in the forest," Varian murmured, eyes reflecting the flickering flames.

Elric scoffed, but his humor was hollow. "Old wives’ tales to scare children."

Yet, as a rabbit burst from the underbrush, its sudden appearance sent a ripple of tension through the gathered men. It was merely a rabbit, yet each man’s hand had gone to his blade, eyes darting.

The forest loomed, a silent watcher, its whispers seeping into their bones. Sleep was a stranger that night. Varian lay awake, mind racing with the possibilities of what moved in the darkness beyond their scant fires.

Dawn brought no comfort. A patrol returned with news of goblin tracks near the border. Fresh. Purposeful. "Scouts," one of the seasoned guards muttered, eyes wide with the realization. "They’re planning something."

"That settles it," Elric declared, his voice cutting through the morning chill. "Sharpen your blades and brace yourselves. Trouble is brewing, and it won’t wait for us to be ready."

Varian walked among the men, their faces set in grim determination. They were farmers, tradesmen, sons of the soil—not warriors. Yet here they stood, on the precipice of conflict. Was it bravery or folly that held them here? Varian wondered silently.

"Whatever comes out of those trees, we'll face it together," Elric assured him, clapping a firm hand on his shoulder. His confidence was a small comfort, but a comfort nonetheless.

As they prepared, the outpost pulsed with a nervous energy. Men whispered of shadows and shapes, eyes darting to the treeline that marked the boundary of the known and the feared. The day wore on, each hour stretching taut like a bowstring pulled to its limit.

Varian and Elric shared a look, an unspoken agreement between old friends. They were in this together, come what may. As the sun began its descent, painting the sky in hues of fire and blood, the outpost held its breath, waiting for the night to reveal its secrets.
