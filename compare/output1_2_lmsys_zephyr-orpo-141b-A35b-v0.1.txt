Today, Varian and Elric strode towards the outpost, both weary and worried about the recent events. Their conversation centered on the goblin attacks, as riders from the frontier villages had reported that goblins had slaughtered three cows without taking their bodies. Varian shared this information with Captain Aldric, mentioning the incident in the village where a girl was attacked but no attacker was found. Captain Aldric, a seasoned soldier, understood the gravity of the situation and ordered increased patrols and a search of the borders.

Varian and Elric voiced their concerns about the outpost being understaffed, and Captain Aldric decided to recruit men from the village to bolster their numbers. Aldric warned them not to enter goblin territory and only to watch and guard. The two friends checked the outpost's defenses and gathered a dozen men from the village to help with patrols. Varian, displaying his leadership skills, assigned the new recruits to four-hour shifts with experienced guards. An uneasy calm settled over the outpost as the patrols began.

During their watch, Varian and Elric discussed the stories they had heard about goblin rituals. Varian believed that evil lived in the forest, and this belief only grew stronger as they saw movement in the trees, which turned out to be a scared rabbit. Varian remained unsettled by the dark and foreboding nature of the forest. The two friends struggled to sleep, haunted by memories and the sense of impending danger.

The next morning, a patrol reported finding goblin tracks along the border, indicating a scouting party. Varian and Elric realized that the goblins were preparing to attack, and they needed to be ready to defend against them. Elric ordered the men to sharpen their weapons and remain vigilant. Varian reflected on the bravery or foolishness of the farmers who lived near the evil forest. He feared that a great evil was stirring in goblin territory. Elric reassured him that they would stand against whatever threat emerged from the trees.

An atmosphere of nervous energy and anticipation permeated the outpost as the men prepared for the impending goblin attack. The stage was set for a confrontation between the outpost and the goblins, with the tension mounting as the men readied themselves for the inevitable clash.
