Varian and Elric trudged towards the outpost, their exhaustion evident in every step. The recent events weighed heavily on their minds, casting a shadow over their usual camaraderie.

As they approached, a pair of riders intercepted them, sharing grim news. Goblins had slaughtered three cows in nearby villages, leaving the carcasses behind. It was an oddity; goblins never wasted food.

Upon arriving, Varian reported the incident involving the attacked girl. No assailant was found, only a lingering sense of dread. Captain Aldric listened intently, his brow furrowing as he grasped the gravity of the situation. He promptly ordered intensified patrols and a thorough search of the borders.

Varian and Elric exchanged worried glances. The outpost was already understaffed, and this would stretch their resources thin. Aldric, noticing their concern, decided to enlist men from the village to aid in their efforts.

"Remember," Aldric cautioned them, "do not enter goblin territory. Your task is to watch and guard, not engage."

Varian and Elric inspected the outpost's defenses, then rallied a dozen villagers to assist with patrols. Varian assigned the new recruits to four-hour shifts alongside experienced guards. An uneasy calm descended upon the outpost as patrols commenced.

During their watch, Varian and Elric discussed the rumors of goblin rituals. Varian believed evil resided within the forest, a sentiment that made Elric uneasy. Suddenly, movement in the trees caught their attention, sending their hearts racing. But it was just a frightened rabbit darting away.

Despite the false alarm, Varian couldn't shake off the unsettling feeling that the forest harbored something sinister. Sleep eluded both friends, their dreams haunted by memories and the looming threat.

The following morning, a patrol returned with goblin tracks along the border, confirming a scouting party. Varian and Elric knew then, that the goblins were preparing to attack. They had to be ready.

Elric commanded the men to sharpen their weapons and stay alert. Varian contemplated the bravery, or perhaps foolishness, of the farmers living so close to the ominous forest. He feared a great evil was stirring within goblin territory.

Elric placed a reassuring hand on Varian's shoulder. "We'll stand against whatever comes from those trees," he vowed.

An air of nervous anticipation filled the outpost as the men readied themselves for the impending goblin attack. The stakes were high, and they were all too aware of it.
