As we trudged towards the outpost, the weight of our exhaustion and worry hung heavy on our shoulders. The recent events had left us both on edge. Elric and I exchanged a concerned glance, our faces reflecting the same unspoken question: what's next?

We met the riders at the outpost's gate, their faces grim. "Goblins, sir," one of them said, his voice low. "They've killed three cows in the frontier villages. No signs of struggle, no bodies taken."

I reported the incident in the village where the girl was attacked, but no attacker was found. Captain Aldric's expression turned grave as he listened. "This is no ordinary goblin behavior," he muttered, stroking his chin. "We need to increase patrols and search the borders. I want to know what's driving them to this."

Elric and I exchanged a worried glance. "Sir, we're short-handed," I pointed out. "We can't afford to spread ourselves too thin."

Captain Aldric's eyes narrowed. "I'll recruit men from the village. We'll need all the help we can get." He turned to us, his voice firm. "Remember, you're to watch and guard. Do not enter goblin territory. We don't know what we're dealing with."

We nodded, our minds racing with the implications. As we checked the outpost's defenses, I couldn't shake the feeling of unease. The forest loomed, dark and foreboding, its secrets hidden behind a veil of shadows.

We gathered a dozen men from the village, assigning them to four-hour shifts with the experienced guards. The new recruits looked nervous, but determined. I gave them a reassuring nod as they took their posts.

As the patrols began, an uneasy calm settled over the outpost. Elric and I stood watch, our eyes scanning the trees. We discussed the stories about goblin rituals, our voices hushed. I believed that evil lived in that forest, its presence seeping into the air like a chill.

During our watch, a movement in the trees caught our attention. My heart skipped a beat as we approached cautiously. But it was just a scared rabbit, its eyes wide with fear. I couldn't help but feel a pang of empathy.

As the night wore on, the darkness seemed to close in around us. I remained unsettled, my senses on high alert. Elric seemed to sense my unease, his hand on my shoulder a reassuring presence.

Sleep eluded us, haunted by memories and the sense of impending danger. The next morning, a patrol reported finding goblin tracks along the border, indicating a scouting party. Elric's face turned grim as we realized the goblins were preparing to attack.

"We need to be ready," he said, his voice low and urgent. "Sharpen your weapons, men. We don't know when they'll strike."

I reflected on the bravery or foolishness of the farmers who lived near the evil forest. Did they know what they were up against? I feared that a great evil was stirring in goblin territory, its power growing with each passing day.

Elric reassured me, his hand on my shoulder. "We'll stand against whatever threat emerges from the trees, Varian. We'll defend our people."

The atmosphere at the outpost was tense, the men's faces set with determination. We knew what was coming. The only question was when.
