The outpost loomed ahead, its wooden walls a welcome sight after the long trek through the forest. Varian and Elric approached, their steps heavy with exhaustion and worry.

"Did you hear? Goblins killed three cows in the frontier villages," a rider called out as he passed. "Didn't even take the bodies."

Varian frowned. "I need to report an incident in the village. A girl was attacked, but we found no attacker."

Captain Aldric listened intently, his brow furrowed. "This is serious. We must increase patrols and search the borders. Leave no stone unturned."

"We're short-handed here," Elric said. "We need more men."

Aldric nodded. "Recruit from the village. But remember, watch and guard only. Do not enter goblin territory."

Varian and Elric set to work, checking the outpost's defenses and gathering a dozen men from the village. Varian assigned them to four-hour shifts alongside experienced guards.

An uneasy calm settled over the outpost as the patrols began. Varian and Elric huddled by the fire, voices low.

"They say goblins perform dark rituals in those woods," Elric whispered.

Varian stared into the flames. "Evil lives in that forest. I can feel it."

A rustle in the trees made them jump. They drew their swords, only to see a scared rabbit dart away.

"Just a rabbit," Elric laughed, but Varian remained tense.

The forest loomed before them, dark and foreboding. Sleep eluded them that night, memories and fears swirling in their minds.

Morning brought grim news. A patrol had found goblin tracks along the border - signs of a scouting party.

"They're preparing to attack," Varian realized. "We must be ready."

Elric ordered the men to sharpen their weapons and remain vigilant. Varian gazed out at the farmlands bordering the forest.

"They're either brave or foolish, living so close to evil," he murmured.

"We'll stand against whatever comes out of those trees," Elric reassured him.

But Varian couldn't shake the feeling that a great evil was stirring in goblin territory. The outpost buzzed with nervous energy as the men prepared for the impending attack.

Would their defenses hold? Or would the goblins' dark magic prove too strong? Only time would tell.

The sound of horse hooves brought Varian back to reality.

"Sir," a young recruit said, eyes wide. "A messenger from the village. Says his farm was attacked last night. His son is missing"

Varian's heart sank. This was no mere raid. The goblins had a sinister purpose, and they grew bolder by the day.

"Ready every man who can wield a sword," he ordered. "Send word to the capital. We need reinforcements."

He turned to Elric. "We cannot wait any longer. We must take the fight to them."

Elric hesitated. "The captain said not to enter their territory."

"I fear we may have no choice. Whatever evil they're planning, we cannot let it come to fruition."

Varian strode towards the armory, mind racing. How many men could they spare for a scouting mission? What horrors awaited them in the goblin caves?

As he sorted through weapons, a glint caught his eye. A golden amulet, hidden beneath a pile of rusty swords.

He lifted it, marveling at the intricate engravings. A rush of power surged through him, ancient and primal.

"Elric," he called. "Have you seen this before?"

But as Elric approached, a searing pain shot through Varian's hand. He dropped the amulet with a cry.

Where it had touched his skin, an angry red mark appeared. A symbol he had never seen before.

"What is it?" Elric asked, alarmed.

"I don't know," Varian said. "But I have a feeling it's connected to all of this somehow."

He wrapped the amulet in a cloth, careful not to touch it again. "We'll show it to the captain. But first, we have a mission to plan."

As they left the armory, the amulet's power pulsed against Varian's chest. A warning, or a promise of what was to come?

He pushed the thought aside. Right now, his duty was clear. Protect the outpost. Find the missing boy.

And destroy whatever evil the goblins had unleashed upon their lands.

The sun beat down mercilessly as they rode out, a small band of the outpost's finest. The forest seemed to watch them, waiting.

In the distance, a plume of smoke rose from the valley. The goblins' stronghold.

Varian gripped his sword, the amulet heavy against his chest.

"For the missing boy," he whispered. "For the light."

And with that, they urged their horses forward, ready to face the darkness ahead.
