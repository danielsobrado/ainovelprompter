The sun dipped low beneath the horizon, casting long shadows across the open plains. Varian and Elric trudged onwards, their weary feet scarring the earth with every step. The air was thick with tension, a heavy silence pressing down on them. They had been dispatched by Captain Aldric to meet with the riders from the outpost. The news they bore was grim.

"Goblins," Varian muttered, his breath fogging the frosty air. "They've killed three cows in the outlying villages."

Elric's brow furrowed. "Without taking the bodies?"

"Aye. A clear sign of aggression."

Upon arriving at the outpost, they relayed their findings to Captain Aldric. The grizzled commander's face hardened, his eyes narrowing. "We must act swiftly," he declared. "Increase the patrols. Scour the borders. Leave no stone unturned."

Varian nodded, but his gaze remained troubled. "We're short-handed, Captain. And the men are weary."

"Then we'll recruit from the village," Aldric resolved. "But mark my words, lads: you're not to venture into goblin territory. Your task is to watch and guard."

Together, Varian and Elric inspected the outpost's defenses, their breaths coming in short puffs. They gathered a dozen men from the village, assigning them four-hour shifts alongside the experienced guards. The tension in the air was palpable, a storm brewing on the horizon.

As night fell, an uneasy calm settled over the outpost. Varian and Elric stood watch, their eyes scanning the darkened forest's edge. Shadows danced eerily in the moonlight, playing tricks on their weary minds.

"Do you think they're out there?" Elric whispered, his voice barely audible above the rustling leaves.

"I know they are," Varian replied, his voice taut with certainty. "Evil lives in that forest. I can feel it."

Elric couldn't help but chuckle, though his laughter held no mirth. "You and your stories, Varian. Tales of goblin rituals and ancient curses."

"Laugh if you will," Varian countered, "but there's truth in these tales. And I fear we're about to witness it firsthand."

A twig snapped in the darkness, sending their hearts racing. A rabbit, startled by their presence, darted away into the underbrush. Relief washed over them, but only briefly. The forest loomed large, a malevolent presence lurking within its depths.

Sleep eluded them that night. Memories of past battles and fears of what lay ahead haunted their dreams. Varian tossed and turned, his mind consumed by images of the darkened forest and the creatures that dwelled within.

Dawn broke, painting the sky with hues of pink and gold. A patrol returned, their faces drawn and pale. "Goblin tracks along the border," one of them reported. "A scouting party, most likely."

Varian exchanged a look with Elric. The threat was real, and it was closer than they'd thought.

"Sharpen your weapons, men," Elric commanded. "We must be ready."

Varian watched as the villagers and guards prepared for battle. Bravery or foolishness, he wondered, to live so close to such an evil place.

As the sun crept higher in the sky, Varian couldn't shake the feeling that a great evil was stirring in goblin territory. But Elric stood by his side, his resolve unwavering. "Whatever lurks in those trees," he vowed, "we'll stand against it, together."

And so they waited, a ragtag band of warriors, their eyes fixed on the darkened forest's edge. The tension hung heavy in the air, a tangible force binding them together.

The battle was coming. They could feel it in their bones. But they were ready. They would face whatever darkness emerged from the trees, and they would face it together.
