Here are some elements of this fantasy text that could be enhanced to align with the standards of commercial fantasy novels:
Character Development:

Provide more background and depth to Varian and Elric's characters. What motivates them? What are their flaws, fears, and aspirations?
Show how the events impact them emotionally to make the characters more relatable.
Introduce more distinct personality traits, quirks or mannerisms to differentiate the characters.

World-Building:

Weave in more vivid descriptions of the setting - sights, sounds, smells. Make the frontier lands and outpost come alive.
Expand on the lore and history of this world. What are the "old tales" of goblins that Elric refers to?
Provide more context around the political/social structures. Why is this outpost important strategically?

Pacing and Narrative Structure:

The pacing feels a bit rushed, jumping from scene to scene. Linger more in key moments to build tension and suspense.
Add more twists, turns and cliffhangers to create a stronger narrative arc and hook readers.
Expand the climax and resolution. The rabbit scene at the end is anticlimactic.

Prose and Style:

The prose is generally solid and reads smoothly. Some lines are quite evocative, like "The woods before them crouched like a living beast, waiting, watching."
However, varying the sentence structures more and tightening wordy passages would enhance the style.
Avoid overused phrases like "eyes narrowed" and cliches like "no sleep came to either man."

Themes and Motifs:

Classic fantasy themes of good vs. evil and dark supernatural threats are present, but could be developed further.
Motifs around vigilance, dread of the unknown, and marshaling forces against darkness have potential if expanded.
Exploring themes around the price of security, frontier life, or man vs. nature could add depth.

Tone and Voice:

The dark, ominous tone is established well, but occasional lighter moments or bits of humor could provide balance.
Give the characters more distinct voices and speech patterns. Let their personalities come through in the dialogue.

Positive Aspects:

Engaging opening that pulls the reader right into the action and establishes the central conflict.
Vivid setting details like the clip-clopping hooves and oppressive night air bring the world to life.
Intriguing plot threads around the cattle attacks and looming goblin threat create suspense.

Areas for Improvement:

The characters feel a bit generic and interchangeable. More development is needed to make them memorable.
The world-building is sparse in parts. More history, lore and context would make the stakes feel higher.
Some of the prose falls into clich√© or overwrought territory at times. Varying the style would improve the flow.

With some refinement in these areas, this text shows promise and could be shaped into an even more engaging fantasy novel opening. The bones of an intriguing story are there, but fleshing out the characters, world-building, pacing and prose would take it to the next level. Focusing on the enduring appeal of classic fantasy themes while putting a fresh spin on the tropes could make this stand out in the genre.
