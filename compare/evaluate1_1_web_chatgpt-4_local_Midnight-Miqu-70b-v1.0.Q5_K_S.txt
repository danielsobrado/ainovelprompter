The fantasy text provides a rich setup with interesting characters, a looming threat, and a sense of urgency. However, there are specific areas that could be refined to better align with commercial fantasy standards:

Character Development
Varian and Elric: These characters are introduced well, with distinct personalities and roles. However, their motivations and backgrounds could be further developed to enhance reader connection. For instance, exploring their past experiences with the goblins or personal stakes in the village's safety would add depth.
Captain Aldric: The captain's role is crucial but lacks depth. Providing more about his past decisions, leadership style, or personal losses could make his character more relatable and complex.
World-Building
The setting is atmospheric, but it could benefit from more detailed descriptions of the landscape, the villages, and the outpost's architecture. This would help readers visualize the scene more vividly and understand the strategic importance of the outpost.
Introducing elements of the local culture, beliefs, or history related to the goblin threat could enrich the world-building. This might include local legends about the goblins or historical conflicts.
Pacing and Narrative Structure
The pacing is appropriate for the setup of a larger conflict, but some sections feel rushed, particularly the planning and execution of the defense strategies. Slowing down key scenes to focus on strategic discussions or preparations could heighten tension and build anticipation.
The narrative structure would benefit from clearer transitions between scenes, perhaps through more distinct breaks or chapters to give readers a moment to absorb the information.
Prose and Style
Clarity and Vividness: The prose is generally clear but can be enhanced with more varied sentence structures and sensory details, especially during action scenes or when describing settings.
Tone and Voice: The tone is appropriately dark and foreboding, yet it occasionally shifts to a more informal style, especially in dialogue. Ensuring a consistent tone that matches the story's gravity would improve immersion.
Themes and Motifs
The themes of community, duty, and impending doom are well introduced but could be deepened through symbols or recurring motifs, such as the depiction of the forest or the goblins' mysterious behaviors.
Exploring themes like sacrifice, heroism, or fear through the villagers' perspectives might add layers to the narrative.
Examples for Enhancement
Original: "Walls were crumbling in places, watchtowers barely manned."
Revised: "The outpost's walls, pockmarked and crumbling, stood as weary sentinels over the sparse, undermanned watchtowers."
Summary of Feedback
Positives:

Strong initial character introductions.
Engaging setup with a clear external conflict.
Effective use of atmospheric tension.
Areas for Improvement:

Needs deeper character development.
Could benefit from richer world-building details.
Pacing and narrative transitions could be smoother to enhance storytelling flow.
Prose could be more vivid and consistent in tone.
By addressing these elements, the text could be refined to enhance its readability, emotional impact, and alignment with commercial fantasy standards.
