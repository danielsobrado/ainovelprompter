The text you provided shows a solid foundation in fantasy storytelling, with elements of adventure, suspense, and conflict that are crucial for the genre. However, there are several areas where it could be enhanced to better align with the standards of commercial fantasy novels:

Character Development
The characters Varian and Elric are introduced, but there is little depth to their personalities or backgrounds. More information about their past experiences, motivations, and emotional states would help readers form a stronger connection with them.
The dialogue offers a basic introduction to their roles but could be more distinctive to each character to showcase their unique traits and development.
World-Building
The setting is mentioned briefly (the dusty path, the outpost, the evil forest), yet it lacks detailed descriptions that could make the world feel more vivid and real.
Incorporating cultural, historical, or environmental details can enrich the setting and provide a more immersive experience for the reader.
Pacing and Narrative Structure
The pacing is fairly steady, which is appropriate for building tension. However, the transitions between scenes can be abrupt, such as the sudden appearance of the riders and the quick jump to preparing for battle.
Consider smoothing transitions with more narrative buildup or reflections from characters to enhance the flow of events.
Prose and Style
The prose is functional but can benefit from more varied sentence structures and a richer vocabulary to enhance vividness and readability.
Some phrases are clich√©d or overly simplistic, which can detract from the overall impact. For example, "Varian's skin prickled with unease" could be rephrased for a fresher expression of fear or anticipation.
Themes and Motifs
The theme of battling an unknown evil is classic in fantasy but could be deepened with symbols or recurring motifs that reflect the larger stakes or the internal conflicts of the characters.
Explore themes like courage, sacrifice, or betrayal more deeply to give the story additional layers of meaning.
Tone and Voice
The tone is consistent with the genre, but it could be enhanced by varying the narrative voice to match the tension or the stakes in different scenes. For example, quieter, more introspective moments could contrast with the action-packed scenes to add emotional depth.
Examples for Enhancement
Instead of "The sun beat down on them," try something more evocative like "The sun scorched the barren landscape around them, a relentless overseer."
Replace "Varian's thoughts turned to the farmers" with "Varian's mind wandered to the farmers, those silent keepers of secrets too dangerous to whisper even in daylight."
Summary of Positives and Negatives
Positives:

Engaging setup with a clear conflict involving goblins and a mysterious force.
Dialogue that propels the plot forward and introduces key elements of the conflict.
Negatives:

Lack of depth in character development and world-building.
Predictable plot without significant twists or unique elements.
Prose could be more vivid and less reliant on familiar fantasy tropes.
Overall, while the text sets up an interesting fantasy scenario, enriching the characters, deepening the world-building, and refining the prose could significantly enhance its appeal and effectiveness within the commercial fantasy genre.
