Here are some key areas where this fantasy text could be enhanced to better align with commercial fantasy novel standards:
Character Development:

While Varian and Elric are distinct characters, their personalities and backstories could be fleshed out more to make them more compelling. Revealing snippets of their past, fears, desires etc. through dialogue and introspection would help readers connect with them emotionally.
The secondary characters like Captain Aldric could also benefit from more nuance and depth. Giving him a unique voice, mannerisms, and motivations would make the character interactions richer.

World-Building:

The evil forest and goblin territory are intriguing concepts that could be expanded upon. Vivid sensory descriptions of the foreboding landscape, eerie sounds, smells etc. would immerse readers deeper into the setting.
Sprinkling in more details about the frontier villages, their culture, beliefs about the goblins etc. would enhance the verisimilitude of the world.

Pacing & Structure:

The pacing is a bit uneven in parts. More dynamic action sequences interspersed with quieter moments of character introspection and dialogue would keep readers engaged.
Structurally, hinting at the characters' goals and the central story question early on would give readers a roadmap of what to expect. Foreshadowing future conflicts would build anticipation.

Prose & Dialogue:

The prose is clear but could use more stylistic variety and sensory vividness. Evocative metaphors, active verbs, specific rather than generic descriptions would immerse readers in the story world.
The dialogue tends to be expository at times, spelling things out bluntly. More subtext, interruptions, distinctive speech patterns for different characters would make conversations feel authentic and engaging.

Themes & Voice:

Classic fantasy motifs like good vs evil, courage in the face of danger are present but could be explored with more depth and nuance to resonate powerfully with readers.
The narrative voice sometimes slips into a distant, removed tone. Using deep POV techniques to immerse readers viscerally in the characters' perceptions and emotions would strengthen the voice.

In summary, this excerpt's strengths include:

Intriguing world with evil creatures and looming danger
Distinct lead characters who take charge in a crisis
Clear, easy-to-follow prose

Areas for improvement are:

Deepening character development and nuance
Enhancing sensory descriptions and immersive world-building
Balancing pacing between action and introspection
Enriching prose with more stylistic variety and metaphorical language
Making dialogue subtler and differentiating characters' voices
Exploring themes with more resonance and depth
Strengthening narrative voice and POV

With some targeted editing and polishing in these areas, this fantasy story could become a more engaging page-turner that captivates fans of the genre. The foundations of an intriguing story are there, it just needs refinement to truly shine.
