Here are some ways this fantasy text could be enhanced to better align with the standards of commercial fantasy novels:
Character Development:

Provide more insight into Varian and Elric's backstories, motivations, and inner conflicts. Show how their past experiences shape their current outlooks and decisions.
Develop the secondary characters like Captain Aldric more. Give him clearer goals and personality traits.
Show more interpersonal dynamics and dialogue between the characters to make them feel more three-dimensional.

World-building:

Include more vivid descriptions of the setting - sights, sounds, smells. Paint an immersive picture of this fantasy world.
Provide more context about the goblins, their society, and the history of their conflict with humans. What motivates them?
Expand on the magic system, religions, politics, cultures and peoples that exist in this realm.

Pacing & Narrative Structure:

The pacing feels a bit uneven, with some segments rushing by and others dwelling too long. Work on maintaining a more consistent narrative flow.
Increase the tension and stakes in the beginning to really hook the reader. Starting with the quiet/uneventful night watch makes for a slower opening.
Sprinkle in more foreshadowing and compelling plot questions to create suspense and keep readers engaged.

Prose & Readability:

Some of the sentences are overly long and complex. Vary sentence lengths and structures for better flow.
The frequent use of ellipses and em dashes disrupts the prose. Use them more sparingly.
Occasionally the wording veers into purple prose, with overly ornate descriptions like "sickly green" and "shades of crimson and shadow". Aim for a more natural voice.

Themes & Tone:

The themes of good vs. evil, an impending dark threat, and the human lands as a bastion of light are common fantasy tropes. Try to put a more unique spin on these.
The tone wavers between dark/gritty and more idealistic. Decide what overall tone you're aiming for and keep it consistent.
Currently, the goblins come across as rather one-dimensional evil monsters. Adding more moral complexity and nuance to the conflict could make it more compelling.

Some positives:

Creates an intriguing fantasy world with goblins, ancient evil, and imperiled human lands
Engaging actions scenes and some evocative imagery and descriptions
The camaraderie between Varian and Elric is portrayed well

Some drawbacks:

Pacing issues and an opening that's slower to engage readers
Characters and themes could be developed in more nuanced, less archetypal ways
The prose is overwritten in places and could be streamlined for better readability

I'd recommend really focusing in on character development, world-building, and pacing as top priorities. Adding more depth to the characters, immersive details to the world, and narrative momentum will go a long way. The prose is solid overall with some nice turns of phrase, but simplifying it in places will improve the style. With some revisions, this could be shaped into an engrossing fantasy tale. Keep at it!
