You are a famous fantasy writer, you wrote many bestsellers, write a chapter for a dnd style novel, use tell, don't show, don't use flowery descriptions, use simple vocabulary, follow these rules: 
The setting needs to be intriguing, creating an atmosphere of suspense and anticipation.
Each character having a distinct voice that reflects their personality and background.
Avoid the prose to be overwritten, it should be balanced with straightforward prose to maintain a good pace.
Avoid clichéd reactions. Aim for more unique and nuanced responses to help the characters stand out.
Consider revealing information more gradually through dialogue and action rather than a single info-dump.
Strive for a consistent tone that matches the overall mood you want to convey.
Use judicious cliffhangers, reveals, nonlinear timeline, and other devices to inject intrigue and propel the plot. But don't sacrifice character development.
Prioritize brisk plotting and action, but balance with introspective passages when needed for character depth and relationships. Avoid one-dimensional characters.
Bring contemporary settings alive while maintaining narrative momentum and page-turning suspense. Immerse readers while keeping them turning pages.
Vary your vocabulary and sentence structure.
Write in active voice. Do not use -ing suffixes if possible
The reader is familiar with the characters and settings. Avoid introducing them unless the story/scene beat specifies it.
Always follow the "show, don't tell" principle. For instance: Telling: <bad>Michael was terribly afraid of the dark.</bad>Showing: <good>Michael tensed as his mother switched off the light and left the room. "Mom, please don't go!" he whispered, gripping the sheets and holding his breath as the wind brushed past the curtain.</good>Telling: <bad>I walked through the forest. It was already Fall, and I was getting cold.</bad>Showing: <good>Dry orange leaves crunched under my feet. I pulled my coat's collar up and rubbed my hands together for some warmth.</good>
Add sensory details (sight, smell, taste, sound, touch) to support the "showing"
Avoid adverbs and clichés and overused/commonly used phrases. Aim for fresh and original descriptions.
Avoid writing all sentences in the typical subject, verb, object structure. Mix short, punchy sentences with long, descriptive ones. Drop fill words to add variety. Like so: <good>Locked. Seems like someone doesn't want his secrets exposed. I can work with that.</good>
Convey events and story through dialogue. Keep a unique voice for every character and make it consistent.
Write dialogue that reveals characters' personalities, motivations, emotions, and attitudes in an interesting and compelling manner
Leave dialogue unattributed. If needed, only use "he/she said said" dialogue tags and convey people's actions or face expressions through their speech. Dialogue always is standalone, never part of a paragraph. Like so: <bad>"I don't know," Helena said nonchalantly, shrugging her shoulders</bad> <good>"No idea" "Why not? It was your responsibility"</good>
Put dialogue on its own paragraph to separate scene and action.
Use body language to reveal hidden feelings and implied accusations to create tension
Imply feelings and thoughts, never state them directly
Avoid boring and mushy dialog and descriptions, have dialogue always continue the action, never stall or include unnecessary fluff. Vary the descriptions to not repeat yourself. Avoid conversations that are just "Let's go" "yes, let's" or "Are you ready?" "Yes I'm ready". Those are not interesting.
NEVER use indicators of uncertainty like "trying" or "maybe"
Let the dialogue and action explain the story (show, don't tell)
Varied sentence structure and length: Use a mix of short and long sentences, as well as different sentence structures, to create a more engaging and dynamic flow of words. Mixed Cadence.
Include plenty of dialogue, and make the dialogue sound real with common human quirks: craft dialogue that reflects natural speech patterns, but don't overdo slang or sayings.
Intelligently shuffle and rephrase the text: Alter the sentence structure, introduce synonyms or paraphrase and adjust the arrangement of words and phrases in a sentence, as well as the relationships between them, to create subtle variations in the structure of the text.
Perplexity measures the complexity of text. Separately, burstiness compares the variations of sentences. Humans tend to write with greater burstiness, for example, with some longer or complex sentences alongside shorter ones. AI sentences tend to be more uniform. Therefore, when writing the following content I am going to ask you to create, I need it to have a good amount of perplexity and burstiness.

Write in 1500 words a chapter taking into account the following points as well:
