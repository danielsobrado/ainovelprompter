Here are some elements of this fantasy text that could be enhanced to align with the standards of commercial fantasy novels:
Character Development:

Provide more background and depth to the main characters Elric and Varian. What motivates them? What are their skills, flaws, and relationships?
Show character growth and development over the course of the story. How do the events impact and change them?
Include more dialogue and interactions to reveal character personalities and dynamics.

World-Building:

Paint a more vivid picture of the setting - the outpost, surrounding village, dark forest. Use sensory details to immerse the reader.
Provide more context about the goblins, their nature, society, and the history of their conflict with humans. What makes them a threat?
Explain the larger world this story takes place in. What is the culture, politics, magic system, mythology?

Pacing & Narrative Structure:

The current pacing feels a bit rushed. Allow more time for scenes to breathe and tension to build.
Follow a clear story structure with an inciting incident, rising action, climax, and resolution. The goblin threat could be foreshadowed and built up more.
Vary the length and rhythm of scenes and sentences. Shorter, punchier lines can quicken the pace while longer, descriptive passages slow things down.

Prose & Style:

The writing is fairly clear and easy to follow. Some sentences could be tightened up to improve flow.
Occasionally the perspective seems to shift between Varian's close 3rd person POV and a more distant omniscient narrator. Staying firmly in Varian's perspective could create a stronger emotional connection.
Use strong, active verbs. Instead of "The outpost bustled with activity" try "Activity bustled through the outpost".
Look for generic words like "things" or "stuff" to replace with more specific, evocative language.

Themes & Motifs:

Classic fantasy themes of good vs evil, civilization vs wilderness, and the hero's journey are hinted at. These could be developed further.
The dark, mysterious forest is a common fantasy motif. Consider ways to give it a unique twist.
Explore thematic questions: What evil lurks in the forest and what does it represent? How does it test the characters' courage, morality, identity?

Tone & Voice:

The grim, ominous tone is established well in places, but wavers a bit in others like Elric's rabbit quip. Keep the tone consistent to build tension and a sense of looming danger.
Give the narrator a distinct voice. Let their personality come through via word choice, humor, insight, etc.

Positive aspects:

Intriguing setup with goblin mystery and looming external threat
Vivid setting details like the weathered outpost and shadowy forest
Clear, easy to follow writing style
Classic fantasy themes and motifs

Areas for improvement:

Characters and world need more depth and development
Pacing feels rushed, story could be structured more dynamically
Prose is occasionally clunky or generic
Narrative distance wavers, POV could be more consistent

With some revision and expansion, this could be shaped into an engrossing fantasy tale. The bones of an intriguing story with external conflict and thematic resonance are there. Focusing on character depth, immersive world-building, a well-structured plot, and polished prose in a distinct authorial voice will help elevate it. Developing the fantasy elements with a unique spin while leveraging classic genre motifs will also allow it to stand out in the market. With refinement, this could be a tense, atmospheric fantasy adventure.
