Here are some specific ways this fantasy text could be enhanced to align with the standards of commercial fantasy novels:
Character Development:

Provide more backstory and depth for the main characters Varian and Elric. What motivates them? What inner conflicts or flaws do they grapple with?
Flesh out supporting characters like Captain Aldric and the villagers/guards. Give them distinct personalities and roles in the story.
Show character growth and change over the course of the narrative. How do the events impact Varian and Elric emotionally and philosophically?

World-building:

Paint a more vivid picture of the setting - the outpost, village, plains, forest. Use sensory details to immerse the reader.
Provide more context about the larger world. What is the socio-political situation? The history between humans and goblins?
Expand on the lore and mythology around the goblins and the "evil" in the forest. Tease out mysteries to engage the reader's curiosity.

Pacing & Structure:

The current pacing feels a bit uneven, alternating between quick action and slower introspection. Aim for a more purposeful ebb and flow.
Consider utilizing classic story structure - inciting incident, rising action, climax, resolution - to give the narrative a stronger arc and momentum.
Potentially expand this excerpt into a longer, more fleshed out story with twists, turns and subplots.

Prose & Readability:

The writing is generally solid and readable. Some turns of phrase are quite evocative, like "the air was thick with tension."
Occasionally the prose veers into being overwritten, like "their weary feet scarring the earth with every step." Go for precision and power over purple prose.
Vary sentence lengths and structures. Occasional fragments or one-word sentences can enhance pacing and punch.

Themes & Tone:

Classic fantasy themes of good vs. evil and an impending battle against dark forces are present. Consider ways to explore these in a fresh way.
The ominous, foreboding tone is well-established. Maintain this consistently to build dread and anticipation.
Varian's belief in old tales versus Elric's skepticism sets up an interesting thematic conflict to potentially explore further.

Positives:

Intriguing setup with tension between humans and goblins
Vivid descriptions that set a dark, ominous mood
Clearly defined characters with different personalities and perspectives
Engaging action mixed with character insights

Negatives:

Pacing is uneven in places
World-building and character development could be deepened
Some moments of purple prose
Story structure and theming could be pushed further

Overall, while this excerpt has a compelling premise and solid writing, there is room to elevate it further through close attention to pacing, structure, characterization, lore-building, and prose styling. Enhancing these elements could help it reach the level of depth, sophistication and reader engagement expected from a mainstream commercial fantasy novel. The foundations are there for an impactful story.
