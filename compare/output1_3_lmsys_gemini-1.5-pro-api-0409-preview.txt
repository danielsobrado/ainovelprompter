The outpost loomed, a shadow against the dying light. Varian rubbed his eyes, fatigue clinging to him like a shroud. Elric, beside him, trudged on, silent. They reached the heavy oak door, its iron hinges groaning as Elric pushed it open. Inside, the air hung thick with the smell of woodsmoke and stale ale.

"Captain Aldric." Varian's voice echoed in the sparsely populated common room.

A gruff figure rose from a table littered with maps and reports. "Varian. Elric. News travels fast."

"We met riders on the road. Three cows, they said. Slaughtered.” Elric leaned against a rough-hewn table, arms crossed.

Aldric grunted. "No sign of the bodies, I wager.”

Varian nodded. "Same in Oakhaven. Girl attacked, dragged off. No trace.”

The captain's eyes narrowed. "Damn goblins. They're getting bolder. This isn't raiding, it's something else.” He slammed a fist on the table. "Double the patrols. Every man on watch. We search the border come daybreak.”

"We're short-handed, Captain.” Elric’s voice held a note of warning.

Aldric scratched his beard. "Then we recruit. Village lads are green, but they can hold a spear."

Varian frowned. "They know nothing of goblins."

"They'll learn. But no chasing shadows. Watch and guard. That's all."

The outpost, a ramshackle collection of wooden buildings, seemed to sag under the weight of the impending threat. Varian and Elric inspected the rickety palisade, the few rusty ballistae, their movements reflecting a shared sense of urgency. A dozen men, farmers and sons, gathered, faces etched with apprehension.

"Four-hour shifts. Stick with the veterans. No heroics." Varian’s voice was sharp, authoritative. He met each man’s gaze, seeking reassurance in their uncertain nods.

Night fell. The forest pressed close, a wall of darkness punctuated by the crackle of torches. An uneasy silence settled over the outpost, broken only by the rhythmic tread of boots on the packed earth.

"They say goblins use the blood for rituals," Elric said, his voice low.

Varian shivered. "Evil lives in that forest, Elric. I feel it."

A movement in the trees. Both men tensed, hands instinctively reaching for their weapons. A rabbit, startled by the light, bolted across the open ground. Varian sighed, but the fear lingered, a cold knot in his gut.

Sleep was a fitful thing. Shadows danced on the rough walls, whispers of past battles echoed in the silence. The girl's screams, the villagers' terrified faces, the stench of blood and fear. Dawn painted the sky with streaks of pale orange, a fragile beauty against the grim reality.

"Tracks along the south border, Captain. Goblins. A scouting party." The young soldier's voice trembled.

"They're planning something," Elric muttered, his jaw clenched tight.

"Sharpen your blades. Stay vigilant.” Varian’s voice was calm, but his eyes held a glint of steel.

He watched the men, their faces grim, determined. Foolish farmers, daring to live so close to the edge of darkness. Or were they brave? He felt a pang of admiration for their resilience, their refusal to be cowed.

"Something wicked stirs in those trees, Elric," he said, his gaze fixed on the dark line of the forest.

Elric clapped a hand on his shoulder, a gesture of reassurance. "Whatever comes out of that darkness, we stand against it. Together."

The air crackled with a nervous energy, the silence pregnant with anticipation. The men waited, weapons at the ready, their faces a mixture of fear and resolve. The forest loomed, a silent, menacing presence. The attack was coming.
