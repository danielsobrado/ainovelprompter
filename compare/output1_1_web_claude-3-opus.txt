Night had fallen by the time Varian and Elric reached the outpost gates. The walls loomed above them, a silent sentry against the dark forest that stretched endlessly to the west. Torches flickered in the chill breeze, casting dancing shadows across the weathered wood.
"Who goes there?" a voice called from the watchtower.
"Varian and Elric, returning from patrol."
A moment later, the gates creaked open. The two men trudged wearily into the courtyard, nodding to the guards as they passed. Varian's hand rested on the pommel of his sword, an unconscious habit borne from years in hostile lands. Beside him, Elric's eyes swept the shadows, ever vigilant.
"Any sign of the beasts?" Captain Aldric emerged from the barracks, his grizzled face tight with concern.
Varian shook his head. "Nothing. But we met riders on the road. They brought grim news."
Aldric's bushy brows knitted together. "Report."
"Three cows slaughtered in as many nights," Elric said. "Frontier villages, west of Millstone Creek. Torn apart by claws and fangs, but the bodies left untouched."
The captain swore under his breath. He glanced at the darkened treeline, as if expecting hordes of goblins to come pouring out at any moment. "Anything else?"
Varian hesitated. The girl's terrified face flashed through his mind - wide eyes, quivering lip, voice shrill with fear. "There was an...incident. In Willowdale."
Aldric's head snapped around. "What kind of incident?"
"A child. A girl. Claims something chased her through the woods." Varian met the captain's gaze steadily. "We found no trace of her attacker. But she was scared witless, sir. I've seen that kind of fear before."
Silence hung heavy in the air. Somewhere deep in the forest, a lone wolf howled, the eerie sound echoing off the ancient trees. Elric shifted uneasily, hand tightening around his spear haft.
"Three dead cows and a frightened child," Aldric muttered. "Goblins grow bold."
"Or desperate," Varian said quietly. "Winter comes. Perhaps their usual prey grows scarce."
The captain grunted. "Bold or desperate, it matters not. We cannot allow such intrusions to stand." He straightened, voice hardening with resolve. "Double the patrols. Scour every inch of the borderlands. And send word to the outlying homesteads - any sign of goblins, any at all, they are to alert us at once."
"Captain..." Elric cleared his throat. "We're stretched thin as is. The outpost..."
"I know." Aldric dragged a hand down his weathered face. "We'll recruit from the village. Every able hand to take up watch."
Varian frowned. Farmers and woodsmen, standing guard against the horrors of the forest? It seemed a desperate measure. But these were desperate times.
He met Aldric's gaze. "I'll gather the men. But captain - some have never even seen a goblin, let alone fought one. They'll need training."
"Then train them." Aldric's tone brooked no argument. "But Varian, Elric - heed me well. Under no circumstances are you to cross into their territory.  Watch and guard only. I'll not have you stirring up the beasts in their own lair."
"Aye, captain."
They spoke no more of goblins that night. But Varian saw the worry in Aldric's eyes, the tension in the set of his jaw. The same unease that had settled in his own gut like a cold stone.

The days passed in a blur of activity - checking defenses, reinforcing walls, drilling the outpost's newest recruits. By the third evening, Varian's arms burned and his voice had gone hoarse from shouting commands. But it was not enough to ward off the clenching dread that gripped him whenever he looked toward the forest.
Elric found him atop the western watchtower, staring out across the night-shrouded trees. For a time they simply stood in companionable silence, listening to the mournful hoot of an owl, the skitter of dead leaves tumbling across the forest floor.
"Do you think the stories are true?" Elric asked at last. "About the...rituals."
Varian picked at the worn wood of the tower railing. In his mind he saw black altars stained with blood, goblin acolytes dancing to the frenzied beat of drums, flames painting their grotesque faces in shades of crimson and shadow.
He shuddered. "I think there is evil in those trees. Evil we've barely begun to comprehend."
Elric huffed a taut breath. "Aye. Well. That's a cheerful thought to leave me with before my watch."
"Get some rest, old friend." Varian clapped him on the shoulder. "Dawn will be here soon enough."
But there was precious little rest to be had that night. Varian lay on his bunk, every creak of the wind-battered walls jolting him back to wakefulness. Memories flickered behind his eyelids - the torn remnants of a lost patrol, blank eyes staring at a smoke-stained sky. Elric's agonized scream as a goblin pike punched through his shield. The air in his lungs turned stale and metallic, reeking of blood and ash.
He came bolt upright, heart hammering against his ribs. Groped for his sword in the dark.
Not real. The past, only the past. He drew a shaking breath, tasting the cool night air, letting it anchor him.
A shout echoed across the courtyard. "Movement! Movement in the trees!"
Varian was on his feet and running before the echoes faded. He took the watchtower steps two at a time, Elric on his heels. "Where?" he demanded.
The sentry pointed with a trembling hand. Moonlight rippled across a sea of leaves, shadows flickering beneath the boughs. Varian squinted, trying to make out...there. A flash of sickly green in the underbrush, there and gone.
His blood turned to ice. "Sound the alarm," he ordered, voice tight. "Get the captain."
"Wait!" Elric's hand shot out, gripping his arm. "Look..."
Varian looked. At first, he saw nothing. Then a flicker of motion drew his eye. Not green this time, but brown. A small, furry shape darting between the roots of an enormous oak. It paused, nose twitching, ears laid flat back against its skull.
A rabbit. Just a frightenedrabbit.
Varian sagged back against the railing. He became aware of his pulse roaring in his ears, the white-knuckled grip on his sword hilt. Deliberately, he pried his fingers loose.
Elric let out an unsteady laugh. "Just a woodland creature. Not quite the terror of the night I imagined."
"This time." Varian couldn't keep the tightness from his voice. He gazed out across the forest, unable to quell the unease twisting his gut. Did the shadows seem to writhe under his scrutiny, as if alive with malicious intent? Did the air hang heavier, tainted by some unnatural miasma?
Or was it just his mind, conjuring phantom threats from mist and moonlight?
He didn't know. But one thing he did know - something was out there, lurking, watching. Waiting for the perfect moment to strike. It was not a matter of if the goblins would attack.
Only when.

Morning brought grim tidings. A patrol returned ashen-faced and grim, bearing news that turned Varian's blood to ice in his veins.
"Tracks, sir. Goblin tracks, fresh ones. Dozens of them, right along the border." The soldier's voice trembled. "It looks like a whole scouting party, moving parallel to our lands."
For a moment, silence reigned in the captain's chamber. Varian exchanged a look with Elric, saw his own fears mirrored in his friend's eyes. This was it, then. The first sign of the coming storm.
Captain Aldric paced to the window, gazing out at the deceptively peaceful forest. "So. They test our defenses."
"Aye," Varian said grimly. "They seek to know our strength. Our numbers. The lay of our territory."
"They prepare for war," Elric finished. His hand strayed unconsciously to the old pike scar on his shield arm.
Aldric turned back to face them. In the light of day, his weathered face seemed to have aged a decade. But his eyes blazed with steadfast resolve.
"Then we shall give them a war." His voice rang out like tempered steel. "Elric, Varian - gather the men. I want every blade sharpened, every bow strung, every hand ready to take up arms at a moment's notice."
"And the border, sir?" Varian asked quietly.
"Seal it. No one in or out without my express command. Post triple watches, day and night." Aldric's gaze was hard as flint. "If the beasts so much as set a single claw across our territory, I want to know of it instantly."
"Yes, captain." They saluted as one, fists to hearts, then strode from the chamber with urgent purpose.
As they walked, Varian found himself staring out at the treeline. At the small, distant specks that marked the homesteads and farmlands that bordered the forest. Those brave fools, living in the shadow of such malevolence day after day. Did they have any inkling of the danger that lurked so close, biding its time, waiting to drag them into the darkness?
"They have no idea, do they?" he murmured. "The evil that stirs just beyond their fences and fields..."
"They soon will," Elric replied grimly. "When the goblins descend upon them with fang and flame, they will know the true face of horror."
Varian's hand tightened on his sword hilt. "Not if we have anything to say about it, my friend."
Elric met his eyes, nodding once. In that moment, an unspoken vow passed between them. Come what may, they would stand against the rising darkness. They would be the shield that guarded the innocent, the sword that battled back the night.
Even if it cost them everything.
