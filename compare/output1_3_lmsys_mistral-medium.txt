Varian and Elric trudged towards the outpost, their bodies weary and minds heavy with recent events. The outpost, a collection of wooden structures surrounded by a tall fence, loomed ahead. A group of riders approached, faces etched with worry.

"Goblins," one rider muttered. "They've killed three cows in the frontier villages and left the bodies."

Varian's eyes narrowed. "Did they take anything?"

"No, nothing," the rider replied.

Varian reported the incident of the girl who was attacked, yet her attacker remained unseen. Captain Aldric, a man with a thick beard and stern gaze, listened intently. He recognized the severity of the situation and ordered increased patrols and a thorough search of the borders.

Varian and Elric shared their concerns about the outpost's lack of manpower. Aldric agreed and decided to recruit men from the village. He warned them sternly, "Do not enter goblin territory. Watch, guard, and protect."

Varian and Elric inspected the outpost's defenses and gathered a dozen men from the village. Varian assigned the recruits to four-hour shifts with experienced guards. As patrols began, an uneasy calm settled over the outpost.

Varian and Elric sat together, discussing the goblin rituals and that something evil lurked in the forest. Varian's beliefs were firm, yet Elric remained skeptical.

During their watch, a rustling in the trees caught their attention. Varian tensed, hand on his sword. The movement revealed a frightened rabbit darting away. Varian's unease lingered, the forest's darkness unsettling him.

Sleep eluded the two friends, their dreams filled with haunting memories and the impending sense of danger. The next morning, a patrol returned with news of goblin tracks found along the border, indicating a scouting party.

Varian and Elric braced themselves for the inevitable attack. Elric ordered the men to sharpen their weapons and remain vigilant. Varian contemplated the bravery or foolishness of the farmers living near the evil forest. He feared a great evil was stirring in the goblin territory.

Elric placed a reassuring hand on Varian's shoulder. "We will stand against whatever emerges from those trees."

An atmosphere of nervous energy and anticipation permeated the outpost as the men prepared for the impending goblin attack. The outpost buzzed with activity, the clanging of metal against whetstones echoing through the air. Varian and Elric stood side by side, watching the forest's edge, waiting for the unknown evil to reveal itself.
