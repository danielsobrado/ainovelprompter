Varian and Elric trudged through the overgrown grass, their boots heavy with fatigue. The outpost loomed ahead, its stone walls a grim reminder of the dangers that lurked beyond its gates.

As they entered the outpost, Varian's eyes scanned the room, taking in the familiar faces of the guards and the captain. Captain Aldric, his graying beard streaked with sweat, greeted them with a curt nod.

"What news from the frontier?" Varian asked, his voice weary.

"Goblins," Elric replied, his eyes darkening. "They've killed three cows, just disappeared."

Captain Aldric's expression turned grim. "No bodies, no signs of struggle. Just... gone."

Varian's grip on his sword tightened. "I'll report it to the village where it happened. See if anyone saw anything unusual."

Elric nodded. "And I'll check the outpost's defenses. Make sure we're prepared for anything."

Captain Aldric's eyes narrowed. "Increased patrols, Varian. And Elric, take a team to search the borders. We need to know what's going on out there."

Varian and Elric exchanged a concerned glance. The outpost was short-handed, and Captain Aldric knew it.

"We'll need to recruit some men from the village," Captain Aldric said, his voice firm but resigned. "But I want you both to remember: we're not going in there. We watch, we wait, and we defend."

Varian's eyes lingered on the captain's words, but he knew they were right. The forest was treacherous, and even with magic, it was no place for the unprepared.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, Varian and Elric took their posts, checking the outpost's defenses and assigning new recruits to four-hour shifts with experienced guards. An uneasy calm settled over the outpost as patrols began, the only sound the creaking of wooden gates and the distant rustling of leaves.

Varian and Elric sat atop the parapet, watching the darkness seep into the forest. They spoke in hushed tones of goblin rituals, their voices low and serious.

"I don't like this," Varian said, his eyes scanning the trees. "There's something evil out there."

Elric nodded, his jaw set. "We'll be ready when it comes."

As they watched, a movement caught their attention – a scared rabbit darting through the underbrush. Varian's hand instinctively went to his sword hilt, his heart pounding in anticipation.

The two friends struggled to sleep, haunted by memories and the sense of impending danger that hung over them like a shroud.

At dawn, a patrol returned, its men bearing news of goblin tracks along the border. Varian and Elric exchanged a grim glance – the goblins were scouting, preparing for an attack.

Elric ordered the men to sharpen their weapons and remain vigilant. Varian's thoughts turned to the farmers who lived near the evil forest, his heart heavy with foreboding.

"A great evil is stirring," he whispered, his eyes fixed on the trees.

Elric placed a hand on his shoulder. "We'll stand against it."

As the outpost stirred to life, an atmosphere of nervous energy and anticipation permeated the air. Varian and Elric knew that the goblins were coming, and they would be ready – but at what cost?
