Varian trudged alongside Elric, their boots crunching on the dusty trail leading to the outpost. Weary eyes scanned the horizon, their minds preoccupied with the recent events. Goblins had been spotted, but no one knew where they came from or what they wanted.

As they approached the outpost, riders caught their attention. "Captain Aldric, we bring news from the frontier villages," one of the riders said, his voice laced with concern.

Varian and Elric exchanged a wary glance. "What's happened?" Varian asked, his tone sharp.

"Goblins killed three cows without taking the bodies," the rider replied. "No signs of struggle or attack, just... nothing. Like they vanished."

Captain Aldric's expression turned grave. "Report this to me in private, please."

Varian and Elric followed the riders to the captain's quarters, their minds racing with worst-case scenarios. Once inside, Aldric shared the news with them. "Goblins have been spotted in the villages, but no one's been attacked. It's as if they're watching us, waiting."

Varian's grip on his sword tightened. "We need to increase patrols andâ€”"

"Agreed," Aldric interrupted. "I'll assign extra guards to the borders. We'll also recruit men from the village to help with watch."

Elric's eyes narrowed. "What about the outpost's defenses?"

Aldric's gaze swept the room. "We'll review the perimeter and make any necessary adjustments. But I warn you, Varian, I don't want you or Elric entering goblin territory without my explicit permission."

Varian nodded, but his mind was already racing with strategies and contingency plans. "We'll be cautious, Captain. We know the risks."

As the sun dipped below the horizon, Varian and Elric joined the outpost's guards for their watch. The air was heavy with tension, the darkness outside seeming to seep into their souls. They checked the defenses, their footsteps quiet on the wooden palisades.

The evening wore on, the only sound the distant rustling of leaves. Varian's thoughts turned to the stories of goblin rituals, the idea of evil lurking in the forest making his skin crawl. Elric's hand brushed against his, a reassuring gesture in the darkness.

As they scanned the trees, a flash of movement caught their attention. A rabbit darted across their path, its large eyes wide with fear. Varian's grip on his sword relaxed, but his unease lingered. The forest was a place of darkness, where evil lived and breathed.

Sleep eluded them, haunted by memories and the sense of impending danger. The next morning, a patrol returned, their faces grim. "Found goblin tracks along the border," one of the guards said. "Looks like they're scouting."

Varian's eyes met Elric's, a silent understanding passing between them. The goblins were preparing to attack, and they had to be ready.

Elric ordered the men to sharpen their weapons, his voice firm and commanding. Varian watched, his mind racing with scenarios and countermeasures. The outpost was on high alert, the air thick with tension and anticipation.

As the sun climbed higher, Varian's thoughts turned to the farmers who lived near the evil forest. Brave or foolish, they risked their lives to eke out a living amidst the shadows. He feared the worst, a great evil stirring in the heart of the goblin territory.

Elric's hand clamped down on his shoulder, a reassuring pressure. "We'll stand against whatever threat emerges from the trees, Varian. Together, we'll defend this outpost and the people we care about."

Varian nodded, his gaze drifting back to the forest. The darkness seemed to be watching, waiting for its moment to strike.
