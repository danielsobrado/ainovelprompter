The outpost stood stark against the bruised sky. Wind bit at Varian's cloak as he and Elric trudged through the mud. Fatigue clung to them, heavier than their packs.

"Hope Aldric has something useful to tell us." Elric's voice rasped.

Varian grunted. His boots squelched in the mud. "More likely just another tale of shadows and whispers."

They found Aldric hunched over a table, a map spread before him like a battlefield. Two riders, faces grim, stood opposite.

"Goblins." One rider spoke, voice tight. "Three cows, dead in the field. No bodies taken."

"Same story from Miller's Ridge." The other rider added, shaking his head. "Just…gone."

Aldric looked up, eyes shadowed. "Varian, you said the girl in Oakhaven, she was attacked?"

"Aye. No sign of the attacker though. Just…gone."

Silence descended, thick and heavy. Aldric tapped a finger on the map. "This isn't raiding. It's something else." He looked at the riders. "Double the patrols. Tell the villages, no one travels alone. And keep an eye on the treeline. We need to know what we're dealing with."

The riders nodded, faces tight, and left. Elric leaned forward, brow furrowed. "Think they're planning something?"

"They're always planning something." Aldric sighed, rubbing his face. "But this… this is different. We're short-handed here. We need more men."

"We can get some from the village," Varian offered. "They won't be soldiers, but they can keep watch."

"See to it. But tell them, no heroics. They stand guard, nothing more. No crossing the border. No engaging." Aldric's voice was sharp, edged with steel.

The outpost was a jumble of activity. The air buzzed with a nervous energy as Varian and Elric organized the men. A dozen villagers, faces pale but resolute, stood ready.

"Four hour shifts," Varian barked, pointing to a group of men huddled around a flickering lantern. "One of ours with each group. No one goes alone. Understand?"

They nodded, eyes wide and uncertain. The night settled in, a blanket of cold and shadows. Varian and Elric stood on the parapet, watching the dark treeline.

"Have you heard the stories?" Varian's voice was low, barely audible above the wind. "The rituals they whisper about in the taverns. The things they say live in the deep woods."

Elric snorted. "Old wives’ tales to scare children. Goblins are scavengers, not demons."

A rustle in the trees made them both stiffen, hands instinctively reaching for their weapons. A rabbit bolted from the undergrowth, its white tail flashing in the moonlight. Elric chuckled, but Varian didn't relax. The forest felt alive, a dark and watchful presence.

Sleep came in fitful bursts, plagued by dreams of shadows and whispers. The next morning, a patrol returned, faces drawn and haggard.

"Tracks," the lead rider reported, voice strained. "Goblin tracks. All along the border. A scouting party."

The outpost held its breath. The air crackled with anticipation. Elric slammed his fist on the table. "Sharpen your blades. This isn't some cattle raid. They're coming."

Varian watched the men prepare, their faces grim, their movements honed by fear and resolve. He thought of the farmers, their homesteads clinging to the edge of the forest, their lives balanced on the edge of a knife. Brave or foolish? Either way, they were in the path of whatever was coming.

"Something wicked lives out there, Elric." The words came out heavy, laden with a certainty that chilled him to the bone.

Elric clapped him on the shoulder, his face set in hard lines. "Then we stand against it. Together."

The wind moaned through the trees, carrying a scent of damp earth and something else… something feral and cold. The outpost stood silent, waiting. Watching. Ready for the storm.
