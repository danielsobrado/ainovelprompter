The hooves of their horses clicked against the cobblestones as Varian and Elric approached the outpost, a weary tension in their posture. Patrols had reported scattered goblin sightings along the border recently - strange events that set the men on edge.

They met with the outpost captain, Aldric, whose brow was heavy with concern. "More livestock attacked last night. Three cows killed out by the frontier villages, no trace of the attackers. And we just got word that a farm girl was assaulted a few miles from here. No one saw the culprit."

Varian shared the details of the incident he had investigated earlier that week. A young girl had been grabbed from behind while doing chores, but managed to break free after landing a solid kick between her attacker’s legs. She hadn’t gotten a good look in her panic, only glimpsing a dark, wiry frame before it disappeared into the tree line.

The attacks were growing bolder, more aggressive. Captain Aldric realized the gravity of the situation immediately. "This cannot stand. Issue orders to double the patrols - I want the border swept at all hours. And send out scouts to search the surrounding wilderness.”

Varian and Elric exchanged an uneasy glance. "We’re already short-handed as it is,” Elric said.

Aldric’s expression was grim. “Then we recruit. Conscript a dozen men from the village if we must. I’ll not have goblins at our doorstep wreaking havoc.”

He turned to Varian and Elric. “You two know these lands better than anyone. Take a detail into the forest, but mark me - no more than a mile over the border. Keep to the shadows, watch and report back only. The last thing we need is a skirmish when we’re not ready for it."

They nodded. Varian felt an ominous weight pressing down as he surveyed the dark tree line. Goblins were vicious, territorial creatures. If they were scouting and testing defenses, an attack could be imminent.

“We’ll shore up what we can here and have a look into those woods,” he said. “But if what I fear is true, we’ll have a war on our hands sooner than we think.”

Over the next few days Varian and Elric worked to reinforce the outpost defenses. The dozen village men Aldric had commissioned were green recruits, but they were strong, with courage in their hearts. Varian paired each with a seasoned guard as he assigned their patrol rotation.

"Four hours on watch, then eight hours rest," he instructed. "Eyes and ears open at all times. Anything stirs out there, we need to know about it first."

An uneasy silence descended on the outpost. Men spoke rarely as they manned the parapets or departed into the shadowy wilderness on patrol. When night fell, an air of breathless anticipation seemed to hang over the encampment. Varian found himself staring into the darkness as he kept watch alongside Elric, peering out at the wall of black trunks. He couldn’t shake the feeling that something ancient and malevolent was staring back.

"Evil lives in this forest, make no mistake," he muttered. "The goblins are merely its instruments. I fear forces we do not yet comprehend are stirring against us."

Elric followed his gaze but said nothing. Later in their small quarters beneath the ramparts, neither could find rest, their minds turning over memories of past conflicts and a creeping sense of impending disaster.

When morning came at last, it offered little comfort. Bleary-eyed, they received a report from the dawn patrol of goblin tracks emerging from the tree line a mile west. A scouting party had been testing their defenses under cover of darkness. There could be no doubt now - the goblins were preparing to attack.

Varian set his mouth in a grim line as he turned to Elric. “Have the men ready their arms and armor. Any sense of security we had is gone. Now we prepare for war."

For hours the outpost rang with the screech of sharpening metal. Archers mended fletchings while swordsmen honed blades to deadly edges. The farmers who had joined them were taught spear and shield drill, their faces pale but resolute.

As Varian watched the display, he marveled at the stubborn courage of these frontier folk who carved out a living on the edge of the wild lands. They knew the dangers that lurked in the shadows, the ravenous evil that wished them dead or driven off. Yet still they remained to work their land in defiance. Reckless bravery or determined foolishness? Perhaps there was little difference on this border.
