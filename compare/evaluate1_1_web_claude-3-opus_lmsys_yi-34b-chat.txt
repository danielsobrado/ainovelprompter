Here are some ways this fantasy text could be enhanced to align with the standards of commercial fantasy novels:
Character Development:

Provide more insight into Varian and Elric's backstories, motivations, and personalities to make them feel more fleshed out and relatable. What drives them? What are their fears and flaws?
Show more of the dynamic and camaraderie between Varian and Elric through additional dialogue and interactions.
Develop Captain Aldric further. What makes him a seasoned leader? Show more of his leadership style and strategic thinking.

World-building:

Paint a more vivid picture of the setting - describe the outpost, the evil forest, the frontier villages in richer detail to immerse the reader in the world. Appeal to multiple senses.
Provide more context around the larger world, political structures, cultures, magic system, etc. Help the reader understand what's at stake.
Expand on the lore and history around the goblins and the evil stirring in their territory to build intrigue.

Pacing & Structure:

The pacing feels a bit rushed. Slow down in key moments to build suspense and atmosphere.
Vary sentence lengths and structure to create a better flow and cadence. Some sentences are repetitive.
Consider expanding this excerpt into a full chapter with a clear inciting incident, rising action, climax and denouement.

Prose & Readability:

Some of the prose tells rather than shows (e.g. "A sense of urgency hung in the air"). Describe the tension through character actions and sensations.
Avoid cliches like "sent a chill down their spines." Find fresher ways to evoke dread and foreboding.
Break up longer paragraphs and vary paragraph lengths to enhance readability.
Use stronger, more specific verbs (e.g. instead of "Their faces bore the weariness", try "Weariness etched lines into their faces")

Themes & Tone:

The tone successfully conveys a sense of impending danger and grim determination. Maintain this consistently.
Common fantasy motifs of good vs. evil and a hero's journey are hinted at. Flesh these out further as the story progresses.
Explore themes of camaraderie, duty, bravery vs. fear more deeply through the characters' actions and choices.

Positive aspects:

Engaging opening that drops the reader right into the action
Intriguing setup with the goblin attacks, mysterious rituals, and sense of growing danger
Camaraderie between Varian and Elric is relatable
Vivid details like the elongated shadows and scared rabbit help set the mood

Areas for improvement:

Characters and world need more depth and development
Pacing feels rushed, key scenes could be slowed down and expanded
Some cliched language and purple prose that could be smoothed out
Structure and themes need to be fleshed out further

Overall, this excerpt shows promise and could be shaped into an engaging opening chapter with more development and polishing. The author has a good instinct for creating atmosphere and tension. Focusing on rounding out the characters, building out the world, and refining the prose would help elevate this to commercial fantasy novel standards. Expanding the excerpt to a full chapter would allow room to explore the hook and themes more deeply.
