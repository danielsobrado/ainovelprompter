Here are some specific elements of this fantasy text that could be enhanced to align with the standards of commercial fantasy novels:
Character Development:

Provide more background and depth for the main characters Varian and Elric. What drives them? What are their fears, hopes, and conflicts?
Develop the supporting characters like Captain Aldric further. Give them distinct personalities and motivations.
Show character growth and change over the course of the story. How do events impact Varian and Elric emotionally and shape their choices?

World-building:

Include more vivid descriptions of the setting to fully immerse the reader. Describe sights, sounds, smells. What makes this fantasy world unique?
Provide relevant history and lore about the goblins, the outpost, the frontier villages. What is the broader context and stakes?
Be consistent with details of the world. Ensure any magic systems or fantastical elements have clear rules.

Pacing and Structure:

The pacing is a bit uneven, with some sections moving too quickly. Allow more breathing room for important scenes and character moments.
Heighten the suspense and tension leading up to major events. Create a clearer narrative arc with rising action, climax, falling action.
Use cliffhangers and foreshadowing effectively to propel the reader forward. End scenes and chapters on intriguing notes.

Prose and Style:

The writing is generally clear and easy to follow. Some turns of phrase are quite evocative, like "The darkness pressed against them like a living thing."
Occasionally the prose tells rather than shows, e.g. "Aldric's warning...lingered in their minds like a dark cloud." Work to convey abstract ideas through concrete details instead.
Vary the sentence structures and lengths for better flow and rhythm. Break up longer sentences.
Enhance the vividness of descriptions. Use sensory details and strong verbs to paint a clear picture.
Ensure the tone and voice are consistent and fit the dark, ominous mood of the story. Avoid overly modern phrasing.

Themes and Motifs:

Classic fantasy motifs of good vs. evil and a hero's journey are hinted at but could be developed further. How do Varian and Elric's struggles connect to larger themes?
The story touches on interesting ideas around the price of vigilance and the vulnerability of border communities. Delve deeper into these.
Consider how to make the themes resonate on a human level. What do Varian and Elric's fears and doubts reflect about the human condition?

An intriguing setup that raises key questions and builds suspense
Vivid dark fantasy atmosphere with looming danger
Easy to follow writing with some evocative descriptions
Focuses on relatable human struggles and dynamics

Negatives:

Pacing is uneven, with some events moving too quickly
