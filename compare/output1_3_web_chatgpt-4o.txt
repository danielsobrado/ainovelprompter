Varian and Elric trudged toward the outpost, their steps heavy with fatigue and worry. The day's events weighed on them, their minds swirling with thoughts of the recent attacks. The outpost loomed ahead, a stark silhouette against the fading light.

"Three cows, Varian," Elric said, his voice laced with frustration. "Three cows, killed by goblins, and not a single body taken. What are they playing at?"

Varian shook his head. "I don't know, but it's not good. There's something off about this."

They reached the outpost, greeted by the weary faces of the riders. One of them, a young man with dirt-streaked cheeks, approached. "More bad news. Goblins hit the frontier villages again. No bodies taken."

Varian sighed. "We need to report this to Captain Aldric. There's more going on than we thought."

Inside the outpost, they found Captain Aldric, his stern face creased with concern. Varian quickly relayed the news about the goblin attacks and the incident in the village where a girl had been attacked, though no attacker had been found.

Aldric's brow furrowed deeper. "This is serious. We need to increase patrols and search the borders. We can't let this escalate."

Elric spoke up, his voice steady but edged with worry. "Captain, we're already short-handed. How are we supposed to cover more ground?"

Aldric nodded, understanding their concern. "We'll recruit men from the village. We need every able-bodied person we can get. But remember, do not enter goblin territory. Watch and guard only."

Varian and Elric left Aldric's quarters and began checking the outpost's defenses. The walls, though sturdy, seemed inadequate against the threat they sensed lurking in the shadows. They gathered a dozen men from the village, explaining the situation and assigning them to four-hour shifts with experienced guards.

An uneasy calm settled over the outpost as the patrols began. Varian and Elric stood watch, their eyes scanning the darkened forest. The wind rustled the leaves, creating an eerie symphony that played on their nerves.

"Do you believe the stories about goblin rituals?" Elric asked, breaking the silence.

Varian's gaze remained fixed on the treeline. "I don't know. But I do believe there's evil in that forest."

A movement in the trees caught their attention. They tensed, weapons ready, only to see a scared rabbit darting out of the underbrush. Varian exhaled, but the unease didn't leave him.

The night dragged on, sleep eluding them as memories of past battles and the sense of impending danger haunted their thoughts. Morning brought little relief. A patrol returned with news of goblin tracks along the border, indicating a scouting party.

Varian and Elric exchanged a grim look. "They're preparing to attack," Varian said. "We need to be ready."

Elric nodded. "Sharpen your weapons. Stay vigilant."

Varian couldn't help but admire the bravery or perhaps foolishness of the farmers who lived near the evil forest. He feared a great evil was stirring in goblin territory, something that would test their resolve and strength.

Elric clapped a hand on Varian's shoulder. "We'll stand against whatever comes. We have to."

As the outpost buzzed with nervous energy and anticipation, the men prepared for the impending goblin attack. Weapons were sharpened, defenses fortified, and patrols doubled. An air of determination mingled with the underlying fear, binding them together in their shared purpose.

The sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows over the outpost. Varian and Elric resumed their watch, the weight of responsibility heavy on their shoulders. The forest loomed dark and foreboding, a constant reminder of the unknown threat that lurked within.

Varian tightened his grip on his sword, his eyes scanning the treeline. He knew they were on the brink of something significant, something that would challenge them all. But with Elric by his side and the men ready to defend their home, he felt a glimmer of hope amidst the encroaching darkness.
