Here are some thoughts on how this fantasy text could be enhanced to align with the standards of commercial fantasy novels:
Character Development:

Varian and Elric could be more thoroughly developed as characters. We get a sense of their vigilance and concern, but more details about their backgrounds, personalities, and motivations would help readers connect with them.
The dynamics and relationship between Varian and Elric could be explored further. Are they friends, rivals, or just fellow soldiers? Showing more of their interactions and dialogue would add depth.
Captain Aldric is mentioned but not really developed as a character. Fleshing out secondary characters like him, even briefly, would enrich the story.

World-building:

The outpost, village, and surrounding lands could be described in more vivid detail to immerse the reader in the fantasy setting. What does the architecture look like? The vegetation and landscape?
More context on the goblins and their conflict with humans would help set the stage. What is the history there? The politics and cultures at play?
The magic system, if there is one, is not really touched upon. Hinting at the role of magic in the world could add intrigue.

Pacing & Structure:

The pacing feels a bit uneven, with some paragraphs rushing through events and others dwelling on small moments. Balancing the rhythm would improve the flow.
There's not a strong sense of narrative arc or plot points being hit. The text could potentially benefit from a clearer inciting incident, rising action, climax and denouement structure.
Splitting the text into shorter paragraphs and adding more scene breaks could make it easier to follow.

Prose & Readability:

Some of the sentences are quite long and complex, which can hinder readability. Varying sentence length and structure would help.
There are a few cliched or vague phrases like "whispers spread like wildfire" and "electric current pulsated through the air". More original and concrete descriptions would be punchier.
The vocabulary walks the line between accessibly straightforward and a more ornate, sometimes awkward style (e.g. "herald the arrival"). Settling on a consistent voice and reading level would strengthenthe prose.

Themes & Tone:

Classic fantasy themes of good vs evil, human vs monster/the unknown, and military life are touched upon but could be developed further.
The darker, foreboding tone set by the goblins' threat is established well. Maintaining that ominous atmosphere consistently will be key.
The camaraderie between the soldiers has potential as a compelling emotional underpinning. Showcasing more of their bonds would give the audience a reason to care and fear for them.

Some positives:

Has an intriguing premise and conflict with the goblins that sets up drama and action
Introduces the fantasy world and characters efficiently
Creates an atmosphere of tension and peril
Hints at compelling themes around monsters, military life, human settlements vs the wild

Some negatives:

Character development is lacking - Varian, Elric and others need to be fleshed out
Pacing and story structure meander without a strong narrative arc yet
The prose is uneven in style and readability
The fantasy world-building is light on vivid detail and context so far

So in summary, while this excerpt has potential, it needs further development of the characters, world, plot, prose, and themes to align with the expectations of polished commercial fantasy novels. Enhancing the aspects outlined above could really elevate the story. The seeds of an engrossing dark fantasy tale are there, waiting to be nurtured and grown.
