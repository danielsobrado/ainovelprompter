Here are some thoughts on how this fantasy text could be enhanced to align with the standards of commercial fantasy novels:
Character Development:

Varian and Elric could be given more distinct personalities, motivations and backstories to make them feel like fully-realized characters the reader can connect with emotionally.
Side characters like Captain Aldric could also be fleshed out more. Brief flashbacks or anecdotes could provide insight into key characters' pasts.
The characters' relationships to each other should be clarified and developed. How did Varian and Elric meet and why are they working together?

World-building:

More vivid descriptions of the setting would help immerse the reader - sights, sounds, smells, geography, culture, history, etc. Make the world feel real and lived-in.
Elaborating on the nature and capabilities of the goblins, their motives, and the broader geopolitical context would provide helpful context.
Mentioning unique elements of this fantasy world, like magic systems, races, religions, politics, would make it feel more distinctive.

Pacing & Structure:

The pacing feels a bit uneven, alternating between slow/descriptive passages and quick plot developments. Aim for a better balance and flow.
Structuring the text into clear scenes with scene breaks when changing time/place would improve clarity and pacing.
Building more narrative tension leading up to the impending goblin attack could create a stronger climax. Foreshadowing and raising the stakes over time.

Prose & Style:

The prose is generally solid with some vivid descriptions, but a thorough line edit could tighten up the language. Avoid overusing adjectives/adverbs.
Varying sentence length and structure would improve the flow. Mix longer descriptive sentences with short, punchy ones.
Showing character emotions through body language, dialogue, and actions rather than just stating them would be more engaging.

Themes & Tone:

Classic fantasy themes of good vs evil and protecting the innocent are present but could be explored in more depth and nuance. Is the conflict really so black and white?
The dark, ominous tone is handled well, but injecting more hope, wonder or humor in places could provide balance and make the darker elements hit harder.
Giving Varian and Elric differing attitudes on the themes (bravery vs. foolishness, pragmatism vs. idealism) could lead to interesting thematic and character tensions.

Some positives:

An intriguing fantasy premise with clear external conflict and stakes
Vivid descriptions of the eerie forest and sense of lurking danger
Solid bones of interesting, archetypical fantasy characters we want to root for

Some areas for improvement:

Pacing and structure need tightening to build tension and payoff
World and character details should be filled in more to increase immersion
Prose could be polished through line editing to enhance style and readability

Overall, this excerpt shows promise and could be developed into an engaging fantasy novel with further refinement of the characters, world-building, pacing, prose and themes. The ingredients are there but need to be fleshed out and balanced to create a truly compelling fantasy tale. With some editing and expansion, this could fit well within the commercial fantasy genre.
