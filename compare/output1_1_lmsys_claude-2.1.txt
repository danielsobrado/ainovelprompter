The hooves of their horses clip-clopped in an urgent rhythm as Varian and Elric rode toward the outpost. Weariness pulled at their bodies after the long journey, but an anxious energy stirred their minds. Recent events left them uneasy about the frontier lands - cattle killed with bodies untouched, a village girl attacked by an unseen assailant.

As they approached the outpost, Varian spotted riders approaching. Hailing them, he received grim news - three more cattle slain in nearby villages, carcasses abandoned. Shadows crossed the faces of the riders as they confirmed the cattle held the same vicious wounds seen before. An oppressive silence followed before they parted ways.

Varian's jaw tightened as he considered the implications. Turning to Elric, he asked, "You don't suppose the village attack ties to these cattle killings? Something sinister lurks in these parts."

Elric's eyes narrowed, his face etched with tension. "I was thinking the same. We’d best inform the captain quickly."

Upon arriving at the outpost, Varian recounted the village incident and their unsettling encounter with the riders. Captain Aldric listened intently, his experienced eyes darkening.

"If the unseen attacker who wounded that girl ties to these cattle slayings, we have a serious threat on our hands,” he said. “I’ll order doubled patrols of the borderlands immediately. We’ll scour every inch of ground if we must to find answers."

Varian shifted his stance. "With respect, Captain, we are already short-handed here. Adding patrols may spread us dangerously thin."

Captain Aldric nodded slowly, contemplating. “You’re right. I’ll put out a call for village men to bolster our numbers.”

Turning to Varian and Elric, he held their gazes with solemn intent. “We must remain vigilant. Guard the grounds without fail, but do not pursue beyond our lands. The goblin forests are not to be trifled with."

The two men gathered weapons and supplies to inspect the outpost’s defenses. Trudging the perimeter, they strengthened barricades and tightened access points. As afternoon waned into evening, a dozen broad-shouldered men from nearby farms arrived.

Varian addressed them firmly but warmly. “Thank you for standing with us. We face dark events and darker tidings. Together, we will keep this outpost safe.”

He organized the village men into patrol teams with seasoned guards. Their enthusiasm would balance the guards’ experience on long, tense watches. Finally, Varian assigned four-hour shifts to allow the men some rest between vigils.

As night enveloped the outpost, an uneasy quietude fell across the grounds. Men roamed with bows taut, ears pricked for any stirrings amiss. Within the main hall, Varian and Elric sat by flickering candles and picked at their supper. Neither tasted the food, minds heavy with concern.

Eventually Elric broke the silence. “The goblins grow bolder, I fear. And their intentions ever darker if the old tales prove true...” His words trailed off as an involuntary shiver took him.

Varian’s eyes narrowed. “You mean the rituals? Sacrifices and black magic?” He snorted in disgust. “Evil lives in those woods, make no mistake. And it is marshalling its forces against us.”

Elric held his troubled gaze but said no more. They soon abandoned any pretense of eating and headed out to walk the grounds themselves.

The night air hung heavy with moisture, amplifying sounds with unnatural crispness. Leaves rustled in the black forest, carrying distorted echoes. Each guard they passed stood taut as a drawn bow, eyes raking the tree line.

As Varian and Elric’s watch shift began, their senses strained for any signs of movement. The woods before them crouched like a living beast, waiting, watching.

Then a sudden blur of motion caught Varian’s eye. He whipped up his bow, arrow nocked and ready. Elric followed suit, his muscles coiled to attack. As they watched, the source of the motion emerged from foliage - a small rabbit, eyes wide with terror, fleeing some unseen threat.

They lowered their weapons as relief washed over them. But Varian felt no sense of ease. If anything, the encounter underscored the lurking dangers hidden by the forest’s dark interior. He could not tear his eyes from the line of trees.

When the watch shift ended, they wearily headed to their beds. But no sleep came to either man. Varian’
