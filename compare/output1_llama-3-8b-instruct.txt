Varian and Elric trudged through the dusty path, their tired eyes scanning the horizon. The sun beat down on them, casting long shadows across the landscape. They had been walking for hours, and the weight of their exhaustion threatened to overwhelm them.

As they approached the outpost, riders on horseback came into view. The men's faces were etched with worry and concern. Varian and Elric quickened their pace, sensing the gravity of the situation.

"Hey, fellas," one of the riders called out, reining in his horse. "We've got trouble. Goblins have killed three cows in the frontier villages, and we haven't found any bodies."

Varian's eyes narrowed. "What do you mean, no bodies?"

The rider shrugged. "Just that the cows were killed, and there's no sign of struggle or any other sign of life. It's like they vanished into thin air."

Elric's brow furrowed. "That's not like goblin behavior. They usually leave a trail of destruction and chaos."

Varian's voice was low and serious. "I think we're dealing with something more sinister here. Something that doesn't want us to know what's happening."

Captain Aldric, the outpost's commander, emerged from the doorway, his expression grave. "Varian, Elric, what's the word?"

Varian briefed him on the situation, and Aldric's face grew more somber. "We need to increase patrols and search the borders. I want to know what's going on and who's behind these attacks."

Varian and Elric exchanged worried glances. They knew the outpost was short-handed, and the thought of venturing into goblin territory made their skin crawl.

Aldric's eyes locked onto theirs. "I want you both to gather a dozen men from the village and help with patrols. But remember, under no circumstances are you to enter goblin territory. Your job is to watch and guard, not to engage with the goblins."

Varian nodded, his mind racing with the implications. He and Elric set off to gather the recruits, their senses heightened as they scanned the surrounding landscape.

As night fell, they checked the outpost's defenses, their eyes adjusting to the darkness. The air was heavy with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves. Varian's skin prickled with unease as he gazed out into the forest, the trees looming like sentinels.

The next morning, a patrol reported finding goblin tracks along the border. Varian and Elric exchanged a grim look. The goblins were preparing to attack, and they knew they had to be ready to defend against them.

"Sharpen your weapons and stay vigilant," Elric ordered the men. "We don't know what we're up against, but we'll face it together."

Varian's thoughts turned to the farmers who lived near the evil forest. He couldn't help but wonder if they knew more than they were letting on. The forest seemed to exude a malevolent energy, and he feared a great evil was stirring in its depths.

Elric's voice cut through his thoughts. "We'll stand against whatever threat emerges from those trees. We won't back down."

As the men prepared for the impending attack, an atmosphere of nervous energy and anticipation permeated the outpost. The darkness of the forest loomed, casting a shadow over their camp.
