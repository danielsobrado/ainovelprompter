Here are some specific elements of this fantasy text that could be enhanced to align with the standards of commercial fantasy novels:
Character Development:

Provide more background and depth for Varian and Elric. What motivates them? What are their flaws, fears, and strengths?
Show character growth and change over the course of the story. How do the events impact them emotionally and influence their choices?
Include more dialogue and interactions to reveal the characters' personalities, relationships, and internal conflicts.

World-Building:

Paint a more vivid picture of the setting - describe the outpost, village, and forest in richer sensory detail to immerse the reader.
Provide more context about the larger world. What is the history and lore around goblins and the conflict? Are there other races, factions, or lands?
Weave in details about the culture, beliefs, magic system, etc. to make the world feel expansive and believable.

Pacing and Narrative Structure:

The current pacing feels a bit rushed. Slow down key scenes and speed up transitions to improve the flow and build tension.
Use a clear story structure with set-up, rising action, climax, falling action and resolution. This excerpt feels like just the beginning.
Vary the lengths of paragraphs and sentences. Some paragraphs are quite long and could be broken up.

Prose and Style:

The writing is generally clear and readable but could be more evocative and immersive. Use metaphors, sensory details, and strong verbs.
Avoid overusing words like "nodded", "eyes", "voices". Vary word choice.
Maintain a consistent omniscient third-person voice. Currently it occasionally slips into the characters' thoughts in a way that feels abrupt.
Use dialogue tags sparingly and instead rely on action beats and vivid dialogue itself to convey tone and emotion.

Themes and Motifs:

Classic fantasy themes of good vs. evil and light vs. darkness are present but could be developed in a more nuanced way.
The motif of the dark, foreboding forest is effective but could be enhanced with more specific, evocative descriptions.
Consider how to tie the external goblin threat to the characters' internal journeys to give the story thematic weight and resonance.

Positive Elements:

Intriguing set-up with looming goblin threat and sense of mystery
Camaraderie between Varian and Elric is well portrayed
Writing style is straightforward and easy to read
Some effective atmospheric descriptions, especially of the forest

Areas for Improvement:

Needs more depth in characterization and world-building
Pacing feels uneven, with some scenes rushed
Prose could be more polished and immersive
Themes and conflicts could be more complex and original

Overall, this excerpt shows promise but would need further development and refinement to meet the standards of a commercially published fantasy novel. With more vivid, evocative prose, robust world-building, in-depth characterization, smoother pacing, and nuanced thematic exploration, the story could become truly engrossing. The bones of an intriguing tale are here, but fleshing it out more fully would elevate it.
