Here are some ways this fantasy text could be enhanced to align with the standards of commercial fantasy novels:
Character Development:

Provide more insight into Varian and Elric's backstories, motivations, and inner conflicts to make them more three-dimensional. What drives and haunts them?
Show more of the dynamic and history between Varian and Elric through dialogue and meaningful interactions, not just shared glances.
Captain Aldric could use more characterization - what about his leadership style and personality make him fit to lead in this crisis?

World-building:

The outpost, surrounding villages, and goblin territory could be described in more vivid, specific detail to fully immerse the reader in this fantasy world.
Provide more context around the geopolitical situation - why are humans and goblins in conflict? What is at stake for each side?
Mention unique elements of culture, history, magic, races, etc. that make this fantasy setting distinct.

Pacing & Structure:

The pacing feels a bit uneven, with some sections rushing through events and others dwelling too long on less important moments. Smooth out the pacing.
Consider starting in a more impactful way - perhaps in the middle of a tense scene - to immediately hook the reader. Then weave in backstory.
The ending is abrupt and feels unresolved. Give a stronger sense of where the story is headed while still creating anticipation for what comes next.

Prose & Readability:

Some of the language is cliched, like "a bitter draught that refused to fade." Aim for fresher, more evocative descriptions.
Vary sentence lengths and structures more to enhance the flow and readability.
Ground the reader with more sensory details - sights, sounds, smells, etc. Make the scenes come alive.

Enhancing the wording in places could heighten the emotional resonance, like:
Instead of: "Varian and Elric exchanged a look, their thoughts echoing the same realization: the goblins were preparing to attack."
Consider: "A knowing look passed between Varian and Elric, a grim understanding settling in their guts like a stone. The goblins were preparing to attack."
Weaving in more concrete, visceral details and a tighter prose style would make the emotions and descriptions pop more.
The text does touch on some common fantasy motifs like an impending battle against evil forces, an outpost on the edge of civilization, inner and outer conflicts, etc. Leaning into the mythic archetypes and themes even more could give the story a more epic, resonant feel.
In summary:
Positives:

An intriguing premise with rising tensions
Touches on classic fantasy themes and tropes
Focuses on relatable human emotions of fear, courage, anticipation

Negatives:

Uneven pacing and abrupt ending
Characters and world need more depth and specificity
Writing style is inconsistent and prose could be more refined

With some development and polishing, this story could become an engrossing fantasy tale. The seeds of fascinating characters, conflicts and lore are there - they just need to be brought into fuller bloom. Vivid details, a driving pace, and a more distinct voice would elevate this to commercial novel standards.
