Here are some ways this fantasy text could be enhanced to align with the standards of commercial fantasy novels:
Character Development:

Provide more depth and backstory for Varian, Elric, and Captain Aldric. What motivates them? What are their flaws and strengths? Help the reader connect with them emotionally.
Show more of the characters' internal thoughts and feelings to make them feel like real, relatable people. Let the reader experience events through their eyes.
Develop the secondary characters more, like the rider who delivered the news. Give them distinct personalities.

World-Building:

Provide more vivid descriptions of the setting - sights, sounds, smells. Make the world come alive in the reader's imagination. What makes this fantasy world unique?
Give more context and history about the goblins, the villages, and the larger realm. What is the lore and mythology of this place?
Sprinkle in more specific details about the culture, politics, magic system, etc. to give the world more depth and verisimilitude.

Pacing & Narrative Structure:

The pacing feels a bit slow, with a lot of buildup but no payoff yet. Consider having some smaller conflicts or action beats earlier on to engage the reader.
The structure jumps around a bit between different times and places. Make sure each scene transition is clear and the narrative has a cohesive flow.
Heighten the tension and stakes more leading up to the imminent goblin attack. Really make the reader feel the impending danger.

Prose & Style:

The prose is generally solid but a bit overwrought at times with dramatic phrases like "the quiet was almost oppressive" or "the weight of his responsibility felt crushing". Go for a slightly more natural, less melodramatic style.
Provide more sensory details in the descriptions. Really try to evoke all five senses to immerse the reader in each moment.
Vary the sentence structure more for better flow. Break up some of the longer sentences.

Themes & Tone:

Classic fantasy themes of good vs evil and an ancient, awakening threat are hinted at. Lean into exploring those more to give the story thematic resonance.
The overall ominous, foreboding tone works well for this kind of story. Maintain that consistently to create the right dark atmosphere.
Look for ways to subvert or add twists to standard fantasy tropes and storylines to make it feel fresh.

Positives:

Establishes an engaging fantasy scenario with looming external threats
Introduces compelling main characters that readers can root for
Creates a tense, ominous atmosphere that pulls the reader in
Prose is generally vivid and evocative

Areas for Improvement:

Pacing is a bit slow with limited payoff so far
World-building elements need to be expanded to give the setting more depth
Character development could be enhanced to make Varian, Elric and others more fully realized
Some of the prose is a bit overwritten and could be tightened up

With some refinement in these areas, this could become an very engaging opening to an epic fantasy novel that draws readers into a richly imagined world full of intrigue and adventure. The core elements are promising but need further development to reach their full potential. Focusing on adding depth to the characters, world, and plot will help elevate this story to professional standards.
