The air was crisp and cold as Varian and Elric approached the outpost, their breath forming clouds of fog in the morning air. The sun had not yet risen, casting an eerie darkness over the land. They had ridden hard, driven by a sense of urgency to report their findings to Captain Aldric.

"We need to tell the captain about the cows," Varian said, his voice tight with concern. "And the girl... we still don't know what happened to her."

Elric nodded, his usually carefree face now etched with worry lines. "Those goblins are getting bolder. First, they take our livestock, now this. It's only a matter of time before they strike again."

The outpost loomed ahead, its walls battered and weathered by countless storms. A sense of foreboding hung heavy in the air as they dismounted and made their way inside.

The riders they had seen earlier greeted them, their faces grim. "More trouble," one of them said without preamble. "Goblins killed three cows in the frontier villages. Didn't take the bodies, just left 'em there."

Varian's jaw clenched. "We've seen the same. Any sign of their scouts?"

"None," the rider replied. "They're like ghosts."

Varian and Elric made their way to Captain Aldric's quarters, their boots echoing on the stone floors. The captain, a grizzled veteran with a no-nonsense demeanor, listened intently as they relayed the recent events.

"This is most concerning," Captain Aldric said, stroking his beard. "We cannot ignore these signs. I will order increased patrols and a thorough search of the borders. Varian, Elric, you will assist me in keeping a close eye on things."

Varian, ever the pragmatist, spoke up. "The outpost is already short-handed, Captain. We'll need more men if we're to properly defend against a potential goblin attack."

Captain Aldric considered this, his eyes narrowing. "Very well. We shall recruit from the village. But be careful—do not enter goblin territory. Your task is to watch and guard."

As they left the captain's quarters, Varian and Elric set about their assigned tasks. They checked the outpost's defenses, ensuring the walls were sturdy and the watchtowers adequately manned. A dozen men from the village were gathered, their faces a mix of determination and apprehension.

Varian, all business, assigned the new recruits to four-hour shifts alongside the more experienced guards. "Stay vigilant," he instructed. "The goblins are cunning and ruthless. Do not let your guard down for a moment."

An uneasy calm settled over the outpost as the patrols began. The sun had risen, casting long shadows across the land, but it did little to dispel the sense of dread that hung in the air.

"You really believe evil lives in that forest?" Elric asked, his eyes fixed on the dense trees that loomed beyond the outpost's walls.

Varian, usually stoic, revealed a hint of the superstition that lay beneath his pragmatic exterior. "I've heard the stories, just as you have. The rituals, the dark magic... It's not something I care to test. We'd be fools to ignore the signs."

As if in response to their words, a movement in the trees caught their attention. They tensed, hands reaching for their weapons, but soon relaxed as a scared rabbit darted out from the underbrush.

Varian let out a breath, his hand resting on the hilt of his sword. "Maybe we're just jumpy," he said, trying to convince himself as much as Elric. "But something feels off about that forest. I can't shake the feeling that we're being watched."

The day turned to night, but the sense of unease did not lift. Varian and Elric, along with the other guards, struggled to sleep, their dreams haunted by memories of past battles and the looming threat of what might come.

The next morning brought no relief. A patrol returned, their faces grave. "Goblin tracks," they reported. "A scouting party, by the looks of it. They're getting bolder, coming closer to the outpost."

Varian and Elric exchanged a weighty glance. "They're preparing to attack," Elric said, his voice grim. "We have to be ready."

Elric's voice carried an edge of command as he ordered the men to sharpen their weapons and stay vigilant. Varian, ever the thinker, reflected on the bravery—or foolishness—of the farmers who chose to live so close to the foreboding forest.

"Do you think they understand the danger?" Varian asked, his eyes fixed on the distant trees.
