The fantasy text provided has a strong foundation with vivid scenes and an engaging narrative that draws readers into the world. However, there are several areas where it could be enhanced to align more closely with the standards of commercial fantasy novels, particularly in character development, world-building, pacing, narrative structure, prose, and thematic consistency. Here's a detailed analysis:

Character Development
Varian and Elric: While they are clearly central to the story, their personalities and backgrounds could be more distinct and fleshed out. Giving them unique traits or deeper personal stakes connected to the conflict could enhance their relatability and the emotional depth of the narrative.
Captain Aldric: As a secondary character, Aldric's role feels functional but flat. Including brief insights into his past or motivations could make his leadership and decisions more compelling.
World-Building
Setting: The descriptions of the outpost and forest are effective but could be enriched with more sensory details and historical context to deepen the readers' immersion in the world.
Cultural Elements: Integrating customs, beliefs, or conflicts within the village or among the goblins could provide a richer backdrop and heighten the stakes.
Pacing and Narrative Structure
The pacing is generally steady, but some sections, such as the discussions between characters, could be tightened to maintain narrative momentum.
The transition between scenes, especially when moving from dialogue to action, sometimes feels abrupt. Smoother transitions that maintain tension could improve the flow.
Prose Clarity and Vividness
While the prose is generally clear and fits the fantasy genre, some sentences are overly complex or passive. Simplifying these could improve clarity and increase impact.
Example for Refinement: "The men moved in quiet efficiency, their movements a silent testament to the gravity of their task." could be sharpened to "The men moved with quiet efficiency, each step a testament to the gravity of their task."
Themes and Motifs
Themes like duty, vigilance, and the unknown are touched upon but could be deepened through the characters' personal stories or the lore of the world.
Exploring the moral ambiguities of the goblins' culture or the villagers' fears could add layers to the narrative.
Tone and Voice Consistency
The tone generally aligns with dark fantasy, but some dialogues (especially motivational speeches) verge on clich√©. Ensuring that each character's voice remains unique and consistent can improve engagement.
Positives
Imagery: The environmental descriptions are vivid and effectively set the mood.
Dialogue: Conversations are generally natural and contribute to world-building and plot progression.
Negatives
Character Depth: Characters need more distinct voices and backgrounds.
Pacing Issues: Some parts could be condensed to improve narrative drive.
Complex Sentences: Some sentences are unnecessarily wordy, which could potentially slow down readers.
Overall, the text has the makings of a compelling fantasy story, but refining character development, deepening world-building, and tightening prose could significantly elevate its appeal and effectiveness.
