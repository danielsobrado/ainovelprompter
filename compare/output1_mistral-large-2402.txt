Varian and Elric trudged towards the outpost, their boots echoing a rhythm of exhaustion and worry. The recent events had left an unsettling taste in their mouths, like a bitter draught that refused to fade.

At the outpost, riders from the frontier villages brought news that chilled their bones. Goblins had slain three cows, a cruel act of violence, and the bodies were left untouched. Varian's mind flickered to the village incident, the girl attacked, her assailant nowhere to be found. He voiced his concerns, his words hanging heavy in the air.

Captain Aldric, a man of steel and sinew, recognized the severity of the situation. His orders were swift and decisive: increase patrols, comb the borders. Varian and Elric exchanged a glance, their thoughts mirroring each other. The outpost was short-handed, a fact as worrying as the goblin threat.

Aldric, reading their silent concern, made a decision. He would recruit men from the village, farmers and smiths who knew the land and could wield a weapon. Varian and Elric nodded, a silent acknowledgment of the captain's wisdom. But Aldric's next words were a stern warning: they were not to enter goblin territory, only to watch and guard.

The outpost buzzed with activity as Varian and Elric checked the defenses, their hearts pounding a rhythm of anticipation and fear. A dozen men from the village arrived, their faces a mix of determination and apprehension. Varian assigned them to four-hour shifts with experienced guards, his voice steady and reassuring.

As the patrols began, an uneasy calm settled over the outpost. Varian and Elric, on their watch, saw a movement in the trees. Their hearts leapt, but it was only a scared rabbit, its eyes wide with terror. Varian's gaze lingered on the forest, a dark and foreboding entity that seemed to have a life of its own.

The two friends struggled to sleep, their minds haunted by memories and the sense of impending danger. The next morning, a patrol reported goblin tracks along the border, a sign of a scouting party. Varian and Elric exchanged a look, their thoughts echoing the same realization: the goblins were preparing to attack.

Elric's orders were clear and concise: sharpen your weapons, stay vigilant. Varian's thoughts wandered to the farmers who lived near the forest, their bravery or foolishness a constant debate in his mind. He feared that a great evil was stirring in the goblin territory, a threat that could engulf them all.

Elric's voice broke through his thoughts, a reassuring presence in the growing chaos. "We will stand against whatever threat emerges from the trees, Varian," he said, his words a promise and a warning.

The outpost was a whirlwind of activity as the men prepared for the impending goblin attack. The air was thick with nervous energy and anticipation, a palpable force that seemed to pulse with every heartbeat. And as they waited, their weapons ready and their minds steady, they knew that the true test of their courage and strength was yet to come.
