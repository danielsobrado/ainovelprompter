The hooves of their horses clicked against stone as Varian and Elric approached the outpost, a lone sentinel against the creeping darkness of the Venirwood. Both men were travel-worn, having ridden since dawn after a sleepless night. Rumors of strange happenings along the forest’s edge weighed heavy on their minds.

Three riders emerged to meet them, faces grim. “Goblins raided the frontier villages last night,” one reported. “Killed three cows but left the carcasses behind, not a bite taken.” The animals had been ripped apart in a savage frenzy, their blood staining the ground black beneath the moonlight.

Varian’s jaw tightened, his fingers curling into a fist. “There was an incident two days past, a young girl attacked while gathering firewood near the treeline. No traces were found, but she still bears the claw marks across her back.”

Captain Aldric listened to the reports, lines creasing his weathered face. He had led the outpost garrison for twelve winters now, but the troubled look in his eyes betrayed the unusual nature of recent events.

“Double the patrols,” he decided, “and send out riders to search the perimeter of the wood. I want to know if so much as a squirrel strays over the border.” The captain turned to Varian and Elric, regarding the capable young soldiers before him. “We’re shorthanded as is. Conscript a dozen men from the village to reinforce the watch.”

Varian opened his mouth to object, but Aldric raised a hand. “Have them report here at first light. They’re not to engage any intruders, only sound the alarm if they spot movement from the trees.” He gripped Varian’s shoulder, expression stern. “And that goes the same for you two. The Venirwood belongs to fell creatures now; the garrison’s duty is to guard this wall, nothing more.”

The two men exchanged a glance but said nothing. They knew well the rumors of what lurked within the shadowed eaves of the forest, though the practical concerns of readying the garrison’s defenses took precedence.

Working through the afternoon, they took stock of equipment and weapons, setting nervous village conscripts to fetching water, preparing fire arrows, and gathering stones for the ramparts. Varian assigned each recruit a four hour watch alongside a seasoned guard. Though he doubted the farmers’ ability with a blade, an extra pair of eyes along the palisade could make all the difference.

As darkness crept over the fortress, an uneasy quiet took hold, broken only by the footfalls of patrols moving along the parapets. Varian kept peering eastward as if to pierce the black wall of tangled trees, wondering what evil now called the woods its own.

“Goblin raids are not so uncommon,” Elric remarked later, seeking to temper his comrade’s mood as they stood watch together. “And the carcasses may have simply been left as bait or warning.”

Varian shook his head. “I’ve heard tales of their kind, the savage rituals they perform under the darkened boughs. The girl’s wounds...something darker is at work here, old friend. This is more than just territorial encroachment.”

A rustle of leaves brought their hands to sword hilts, but the culprit turned out to be a single startled hare bolting across the moon-limned clearing. Still, Varian could not shake the creeping dread that clung to his heart. The forest’s brooding air carried a palpable malevolence to it, like the gathering thunderheads preceding a storm.

Exhaustion eventually drove the two comrades to their bedrolls, though neither found easy sleep. Varian’s dreams were plagued by a great shadow rising from gnarled tree roots, bloody symbols glowing in the dark beneath its hulking form. Somewhere, lost voices screamed out in rage and pain...

They were roused at dawn by a commotion in the yard. A weary patrol had just returned, their boots caked in mud and leaves. “We caught sight of their tracks, captain,” one man mewed, still shaken by the discovery. “Small raiding bands by the look, moving under the cover of nightfall.”

Varian and Elric locked eyes in grim acknowledgment. If goblin scouts were probing the forest’s edge, it meant others were preparing the way. The time for action was fast approaching.

By mid morning, Elric had the recruits busy sharpening swords or fletching arrows, barking the odd word of encouragement as they worked. “Steady hands, lads. Be vigilant but
