Here are some ways this fantasy text could be enhanced to align with the standards of commercial fantasy novels:
Character Development:

Provide more details about Varian and Elric's backstories, motivations, and unique traits to make them feel like fully-realized characters the reader can connect with emotionally.
Show their thoughts and feelings through actions and dialogue, not just narration.
Develop the supporting characters like Captain Aldric and the villagers to give the world more depth.

World-Building:

Describe the outpost, surrounding villages, and forest in vivid sensory detail to immerse the reader in the fantasy setting. What does it look, sound, and smell like?
Provide more context about the conflict with the goblins. What is the history between humans and goblins in this world? What are goblin society and motivations like?
Sprinkle in details about the larger world, belief systems, magic, etc. to make it feel like a living, breathing fantasy realm.

Pacing & Narrative Structure:

The pacing feels a bit rushed, moving quickly from scene to scene. Slow down and let pivotal moments breathe. Build tension and anticipation leading up to major events.
Vary the sentence structure and rhythm. Some sentences are repetitive (e.g. starting with a name).
Consider expanding this excerpt into a longer chapter with a clear inciting incident, rising action, climax and resolution to give it a satisfying narrative arc.

Prose & Style:

The prose is clear and readable but could use more sensory vividness and emotive language to fully transport the reader. Paint a picture and evoke feeling.
Some of the wording and dialogue feels a bit generic fantasy. Give the characters distinct voices.
Tighten up the descriptions in places, choosing strong, specific verbs and nouns. For example, "casting a shadow over their usual camaraderie" could be more visceral.

Handling of Fantasy Tropes:

Classic fantasy tropes like an evil stirring, patrols of a border outpost, and impending goblin attacks are present. Find ways to put a fresh spin on these.
Explore the themes of good vs evil, bravery vs foolishness hinted at here. How do the characters grapple with these in nuanced ways?
The ominous tone around the forest and goblins works well to create an atmosphere of dread. Sustain this throughout.

Positives:

Engaging start that throws the reader into a tense situation
Intriguing setup with mysteries around the killed cows and attacked girl
Camaraderie between Varian and Elric seems like a strength to build on
Some vivid details like the frightened rabbit darting from the trees

Negatives:

Pacing feels rushed, not giving key scenes enough room to breathe
Descriptions and language could be more vivid and evocative
Characters and world need more depth and specificity to be maximally engaging
Plot beats and fantasy tropes feel a bit generic so far

In summary, while this excerpt has potential, it needs further development in terms of characterization, world-building, pacing, and prose style to reach the caliber of a riveting commercial fantasy novel. Focusing on vividly immersing the reader, evoking emotion, and putting fresh spins on fantasy tropes will help elevate it. The bones of an intriguing story are here but they need more authorial craft applied to really bring them to life. Honing the narrative structure and giving each scene more room to make an impact will allow the novel to engross fantasy readers.
