Varian's boots crunched on the gravel as he and Elric approached the outpost. Their steps were heavy, matching the burdens on their minds. Varian's brow furrowed as he recounted the troubling news they had just heard from a group of riders. "Three cows slain in the frontier villages, and not a single body taken," he said, his voice low.

Elric nodded, his face drawn tight. "It's not like goblins to leave their kill," he murmured, glancing back towards the shadowy tree line that marked the edge of the forest. They reached the sturdy gates of the outpost, the setting sun casting long shadows over the wooden fortifications that had seen better days.

Inside, Captain Aldric was organizing the evening's watch. His face grew serious as Varian relayed their findings. "No attacker found, and now this with the cows," Varian added, tension lining his voice.

Aldric's eyes narrowed, understanding the gravity of the situation. "We need to tighten security. I’ll order increased patrols immediately and start a thorough search along the borders at first light," he decided, his voice carrying the weight of command.

Varian and Elric shared a look of concern. "We're short-handed as it is," Varian pointed out. Aldric's jaw set firmly. "Then we'll recruit from the village. We need every able body to stand watch."

The next few hours saw Varian and Elric overseeing the outpost’s defenses. They gathered a dozen men from the nearby village, their faces etched with determination and fear. Varian assigned the new recruits to shifts alongside the seasoned guards, ensuring each man understood the severity of their task.

As night fell, an uneasy calm settled over the outpost. Varian and Elric, stationed on the eastern watchtower, spoke in hushed tones about the goblin rituals they had heard in stories. "Evil lives in that forest," Varian whispered, his gaze fixed on the dense thicket that bordered their land.

A rustle from the underbrush startled them, but it was only a rabbit, its eyes wide with fear. Even the forest animals are on edge, Varian thought, his unease growing. The night dragged on, with Varian and Elric taking turns trying to snatch some rest, but sleep eluded them both, haunted by the weight of impending danger.

Dawn broke with a report from one of the morning patrols. "Tracks, sir, goblin tracks near the western edge," a young scout reported, out of breath from his hurried journey. Varian and Elric exchanged a grim look. "They’re scouting our defenses," Elric concluded.

"Prepare for an attack," Varian ordered, his voice steady but his heart pounding. "Sharpen your weapons and stay vigilant. We don’t know when they might strike."

Throughout the day, the outpost buzzed with nervous energy. Men sharpened blades and reinforced gates, their actions fueled by a mix of fear and adrenaline. Varian moved among them, his presence a reassuring force despite his own fears.

"They think we’re unprepared," Elric said as he joined Varian on the wall later that afternoon. "But we'll show them otherwise."

Varian looked out over the fields, the dark forest looming ominously in the distance. "It’s not just about being prepared," he said slowly. "It’s about understanding what we’re facing. Whatever stirs in that forest is more than just goblins. It’s something... darker."

Elric placed a firm hand on Varian’s shoulder. "Then we stand together, no matter what comes out of those trees," he declared. Varian nodded, drawing strength from his friend's resolve.

As the sun set, casting a crimson glow over the outpost, Varian thought about the bravery—or perhaps foolishness—of those who chose to live so close to such darkness. He wondered if they truly understood the danger lurking just beyond their homes.

The outpost stood ready, the men tense but determined as they waited for the night to bring whatever horrors it held. Varian looked to the stars, hoping for courage. In the quiet before the storm, the whispers of the woods seemed to promise that their resolve would soon be tested.
