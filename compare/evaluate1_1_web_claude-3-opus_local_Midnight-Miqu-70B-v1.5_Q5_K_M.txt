Here are some specific elements of this fantasy text that could be enhanced to align with the standards of commercial fantasy novels:
Character Development:

The characters of Varian and Elric could be fleshed out more. Give the reader a better sense of their backstories, motivations, unique traits and flaws. Make them feel like real, three-dimensional people the reader can empathize with and root for.
While the friendship between Varian and Elric is emphasized, showing more of their dynamic and how they complement each other would strengthen their bond in the reader's eyes. Small moments of interaction and dialogue could help with this.
Captain Aldric is introduced but remains a bit one-dimensional. Giving him more depth, even in a short story, would make him feel like an integral character rather than a stock authority figure.

World-Building:

The fantasy setting has potential but needs more vivid details and sensory descriptions to really come alive for the reader. What sights, sounds, smells and textures define this world? More specificity would enhance the atmosphere.
Some information about the larger world beyond just this outpost and village would provide helpful context and scope, making the stakes feel bigger. What is the governmental, social and religious structure of the land?
The goblin threat is intriguing but vague. More hints about their nature, capabilities, and the broader consequences if they succeed would create a more concrete and impactful villain.

Pacing & Structure:

The beginning effectively sets an ominous tone and introduces the central threat. However, the pacing in the middle becomes a bit choppy, jumping from scene to scene without enough connective tissue or character moments to balance out the action.
The climactic battle at the end is described in broad strokes. Zooming in more on the tactical details and character actions/reactions during the fight would make it more visceral and suspenseful for the reader.
The resolution after the battle is very brief. Taking a bit more time to show the fallout, the characters processing what happened, and clearly setting up future stories would provide a more satisfying denouement.

Prose & Readability:

The prose is generally solid and reads smoothly. The strongest lines are those that evoke a vivid image or feeling, like "The air grew thick with the scent of blood and sweat, each clash of swords ringing out like a funeral knell." Focusing on this type of sensory, emotionally resonant description would enhance the vividness.
Some of the dialogue tags are a bit cliche or redundant, like "he said with gravity" or "his voice tight with anticipation and fear." Cutting these or finding fresher ways to express tone and emotion would improve the flow.
Occasionally the perspective seems to shift between omniscient and a tighter 3rd person POV. Remaining firmly in one or the other, or being very intentional with shifts, would keep the voice more consistent.

Themes & Motifs:

Classic fantasy themes of good vs evil, friendship, and courageously facing the unknown are present, which grounds the story in the genre. The steadfast bond between Varian and Elric, and how that impacts the larger conflict, is a strong central motif that could be developed even further.
The story touches on some thought-provoking ideas about why the villagers choose to live so close to danger, and what Varian and Elric are really fighting for. Delving deeper into these themes could give the story more resonance and meaning.

Positives:

Engaging hook that immediately establishes the stakes and central conflict
Strong sense of foreboding and escalating danger throughout
Emotional core in the friendship between Varian and Elric
Vivid battle descriptions that convey the chaos and peril
Intriguing fantasy elements with the goblins and larger world hinted at

Negatives:

Supporting characters and world-building need more depth and detail
Pacing stutters slightly in places, with choppiness between scenes
Some cliche or obvious word choices and dialogue tags
The resolution feels a bit abrupt and unsatisfying after the climax
Thematic potential and character arcs not quite fully realized

Overall, this excerpt demonstrates strong instincts for the fantasy genre and showcases an imaginative story with clear potential. With some targeted development of the characters and world, more meticulous crafting of the pacing and prose, and greater commitment to its central themes, this tale could grow into an even more impactful and commercially compelling fantasy narrative. The bones of the story are solid, but fleshing it out more would allow readers to become truly transported and invested.
