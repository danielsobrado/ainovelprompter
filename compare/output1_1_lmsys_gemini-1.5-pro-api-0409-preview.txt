The outpost stood like a lone sentinel. Grey, weathered wood, scarred by years of harsh weather. Wind howled through the gaps in the palisade.

"Hope they got something stronger than ale inside." Elric rubbed his hands together.

Varian just nodded. They walked through the gate.

Captain Aldric sat at a rough-hewn table, studying a map. He looked up, face grim. "News from the riders. Goblins."

"More raids?" Varian leaned against the table.

"Three cows. Frontier villages. No bodies." Aldric pointed at the map. "Here, here, and here."

"They ever do that before?" Elric frowned.

"Never. Took the livestock, always." Aldric drummed his fingers on the table. "Heard about the girl?"

"The attack?" Varian straightened. "They never found the attacker."

"Same pattern. Goblins in the area, then the attack. No trace." Aldric stood up. "This is serious. Double the patrols. Search the borders." He looked at them. "We're short-handed."

"We can get men from the village." Varian didn't hesitate.

"Good. But tell them, no entering goblin territory. Watch and guard, that's all." Aldric's voice was firm.

The outpost bustled with activity. Men shouted, the clang of metal on metal filled the air.

"Looks like new recruits." Elric pointed to a group of men, faces pale, clutching spears.

"We'll need to organize them." Varian walked over to the men. "Four-hour shifts. Experienced guards with each group."

The sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows. The forest loomed, dark and silent.

"Heard stories about goblin rituals." Elric shivered. "They say evil lives in that forest."

"Just stories." Varian tried to sound confident, but the darkness made him uneasy.

A rustle in the trees. Varian grabbed his sword, heart pounding. A rabbit darted out, white tail flashing.

"Just a rabbit." Elric chuckled. But Varian couldn't shake the feeling of unease. The forest felt alive, watching them.

Sleep came in snatches. Memories of past raids, the girl's screams, the emptiness of the forest.

Morning arrived, grey and cold. A patrol returned, faces grim.

"Goblin tracks." The leader pointed to the map. "Along the border. Scouting party."

"They are preparing to attack." Varian felt a chill.

"We'll be ready." Elric's hand rested on his sword hilt. "Sharpen your weapons! Stay vigilant!" His voice echoed through the outpost.

Varian watched the men, faces hardened with determination. Brave fools, he thought. Living so close to that evil forest.

"Something's happening, Elric." He looked at the forest, a knot of dread in his stomach. "Something big."

"We'll face it. Whatever comes out of those trees." Elric's voice was steady.

The outpost held its breath. Waiting. Watching. The silence before the storm.
