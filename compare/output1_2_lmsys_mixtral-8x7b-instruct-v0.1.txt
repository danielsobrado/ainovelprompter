Varian and Elric trudged towards the outpost, their footfalls heavy with fatigue and anxiety. The sun dipped low, casting long shadows that seemed to writhe and twist like malevolent serpents. They exchanged worried glances as they approached the outpost, their thoughts consumed by the recent spate of inexplicable goblin attacks.

Upon reaching the outpost, they were met by a group of riders, their faces etched with fear and confusion. "Goblins," one of them stammered, his voice quivering. "Three cows slain in the frontier villages, bodies left to rot."

Varian's heart sank. He recounted the incident in the village, where a young girl had been attacked, the assailant vanishing into thin air. Captain Aldric, the outpost's commander, listened gravely, his eyes narrowing as he processed the information.

"This is serious," he muttered, his voice laden with concern. He ordered an increase in patrols and a thorough search of the borders. Varian and Elric voiced their concerns about the outpost's manpower shortage, prompting Aldric to recruit men from the nearby village.

"But remember," Aldric warned, his gaze stern, "do not venture into goblin territory. Observe and guard, but do not engage."

Varian and Elric nodded, their faces grim. They inspected the outpost's defenses, recruiting a dozen men from the village to assist with patrols. Varian assigned the new recruits to four-hour shifts alongside experienced guards, his mind racing with thoughts of the impending threat.

An uneasy calm settled over the outpost as the patrols began. Varian and Elric discussed the chilling tales of goblin rituals, the former unable to shake off the feeling that an ancient evil lurked within the forest's depths.

During their watch, they spotted a rustling in the trees, their hearts pounding in their chests. But it was merely a frightened rabbit, darting away into the undergrowth. Varian's sense of unease, however, remained.

Sleep eluded them that night, their minds plagued by memories and an overwhelming sense of impending doom. The next morning, a patrol reported finding goblin tracks along the border, confirming their worst fears.

"They're scouting," Elric said, his voice taut with tension. "Preparing to attack."

Varian's heart clenched. He ordered the men to sharpen their weapons and remain vigilant, his thoughts drifting to the brave or reckless farmers who lived near the cursed forest.

He feared a great evil was stirring in goblin territory. Elric, noticing his friend's apprehension, offered a reassuring nod. "Whatever threat emerges from those trees, we'll stand against it," he said, his voice steady and resolute.

The outpost buzzed with nervous energy and anticipation, the men preparing for the impending goblin attack. The air was thick with tension, the forest looming ominously in the distance, its dark depths hiding a foe they knew little about.
