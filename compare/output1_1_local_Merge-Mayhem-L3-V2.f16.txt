Varian trudged alongside Elric, his boots scuffling against the dusty trail leading to the outpost. Fatigue etched lines on their faces, mirroring the worry that had been growing since the news of goblin attacks reached them. The silence between them was heavy with unspoken concerns.

As they approached the outpost, riders appeared at a gallop, their horses' hooves kicking up clouds of dirt. "What news do you bring?" Captain Aldric called out, his voice firm but weary.

One of the riders dismounted, wiping sweat from his brow. "Captain, we've had reports of three cows killed in frontier villages... and no sign of any attacker."

Varian's grip on Elric's arm tightened. "Goblin attacks," he muttered, his tone a mix of fear and determination.

Aldric's expression turned grim. "Report to the village elder, Varian. Inform him of the situation." The captain's eyes never left the riders as they continued their stories. "These aren't just random killings... it feels like something's stirring in those woods."

Varian relayed Aldric's message and found himself facing a young girl, her eyes wide with fear. She recounted an attack that had occurred near her home, leaving her shaken but unharmed.

As Varian reported back to Captain Aldric, the officer listened intently before barking orders. "Increased patrols and a thorough search of our borders. We need to know what we're up against."

Varian and Elric exchanged worried glances. The outpost was already short-staffed; taking men from the village would leave them vulnerable.

Aldric noticed their concern. "We'll recruit willing volunteers, but remember – goblin territory is off-limits. Our role is to guard this outpost, not engage with the enemy."

The two friends checked the defenses, ensuring they were secure and well-manned. They gathered a dozen villagers to join the patrols, assigning them to four-hour shifts alongside experienced guards.

As night fell, an uneasy calm settled over the outpost. The men's laughter and whispers seemed distant, muffled by the darkness that crept in from the forest. Varian paced the battlements, his thoughts consumed by the stories of goblin rituals that whispered evil into the trees' ears.

During their watch, they spotted movement in the shadows – a scared rabbit darted across their path, sending a chill down Varian's spine.

"Looks like our only visitor for tonight," Elric said, a hint of amusement in his voice.

Varian's unease lingered as he struggled to sleep. Memories of past battles and the sense of impending danger kept him awake. He knew that goblins didn't just kill for food; there was something more sinister at play.

The next morning brought reports of goblin tracks along the border – a scouting party, most likely. Elric called out, "Sharpen your blades! We're on high alert!"

Varian's eyes met Elric's, both understanding that the time for caution had passed. The forest held secrets they couldn't ignore; it was only a matter of time before the goblins made their move.

As the men prepared for battle, Varian couldn't help but think about the farmers who lived near this cursed land – brave or foolish, he didn't know which. He feared that darkness was stirring in those woods, something ancient and evil.

Elric placed a hand on his shoulder. "We'll stand against whatever comes our way," he said, his voice firm.

Varian nodded, a sense of resolve settling within him. The outpost's men were ready to defend their home; now it was up to them to prepare for the fight of their lives.

As they stood watch, the air seemed heavier, thick with anticipation and fear. The goblins might have started something, but Varian and Elric would finish it – or die trying.

The forest loomed before them, its shadows cast long and ominous across the ground. In this moment, it was hard to tell which of them held more terror: the darkness within or the monsters lurking beyond. Only time would reveal their fate.
