Varian's boots crunched against gravel as he trudged alongside Elric towards the outpost. Tiredness etched lines in their faces, mirroring the weariness that clung to them like stubborn shadows - weariness brought on by recent troubling events and a palpable sense of impending danger.

Their conversation was sparse as they made their way through the quiet forest towards the outpost nestled within its dark embrace.

Back at the outpost, Captain Aldric greeted them with weary eyes and furrowed brow. "Varian, Elric," he began, his voice heavy with concern. "The riders returned with troubling news. The goblins have killed three cows in frontier villages."

"And I've just received word that a girl was attacked near the outpost but no one caught sight of any attacker. It seems they strike when we least expect it," added Aldric, his worry evident in every line on his face. The gravity of the situation hung heavily around them like an ominous cloud.

Aldric's eyes hardened as he spoke next. "We must bolster our defenses and keep a watchful eye out for any sign of movement or anomaly." His words cut through the air, stirring up a sense of urgency that matched their growing unease.
