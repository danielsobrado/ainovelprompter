The sun dipped below the horizon, casting the outpost in an eerie twilight. Varian and Elric trudged along the worn path, their boots crunching on the gravel. A heavy silence hung between them, broken only by the occasional rustle of leaves in the wind. Varian's brow was furrowed, his eyes scanning the tree line with a mix of worry and determination. Elric, on the other hand, seemed lost in thought, his gaze fixed on the distant mountains.

As they approached the outpost, they noticed a group of riders gathered near the entrance. Varian's heart skipped a beat as he recognized the leader, a seasoned warrior named Alden. He urged his horse forward, his expression grave.

"Varian, Elric," Alden greeted, his voice solemn. "We've had some troubling news from the frontier villages. Goblins have been sighted, killing livestock without taking the bodies."

Varian felt a chill run down his spine. Goblins were known to be vicious and cunning, but this behavior was unusual. "Have they attacked any villagers?" he asked, his voice barely above a whisper.

Alden shook his head. "Not yet, but we can't ignore this. I've sent word to Captain Aldric. He'll want to hear about this."

Varian nodded, his mind racing with possibilities. He had reported the incident with the girl in the village, but no attacker had been found. Could the goblins be responsible? He shuddered at the thought.

As they entered the outpost, they found Captain Aldric already in deep discussion with his advisors. Varian could see the seriousness in the captain's eyes as he listened to Alden's report. When the captain looked up and saw Varian and Elric, he beckoned them closer.

"Varian, Elric," he began, his voice steady. "We have a situation. Goblins have been sighted near the frontier villages, killing livestock. I want increased patrols and a thorough search of the borders. We need to know what we're dealing with."

Varian nodded, understanding the gravity of the situation. But a nagging thought lingered in the back of his mind. The outpost was already short-handed. How could they spare men for increased patrols?

As if reading his thoughts, Captain Aldric turned to him. "Varian, I need you and Elric to help organize the men. We'll need every able-bodied person we can get."

Elric spoke up, his voice filled with concern. "But captain, with the outpost being short-handed, how can we spare men for patrols?"

Captain Aldric sighed, rubbing his temples. "I know, but we have no choice. We'll have to recruit men from the village. I'll send word to the elders. In the meantime, I want you two to check the outpost's defenses and gather a dozen men from the village to help with patrols."

Varian nodded, exchanging a worried glance with Elric. This was a dire situation, and they had to be ready for anything.

As they set about their tasks, Varian couldn't shake off the feeling of unease. The forest felt darker, more foreboding than ever. He remembered the stories about goblin rituals, of the evil that lived in the forest. He believed it, and he feared that a great evil was stirring in goblin territory.

That night, as they kept watch, a sudden movement in the trees caught their attention. Varian's heart pounded in his chest as he reached for his sword, his eyes straining to see through the darkness. But it was only a scared rabbit, its eyes reflecting the moonlight as it darted away.

Varian let out a sigh of relief, but the unease remained. The forest was alive with whispers, the wind carrying a chilling message. He glanced at Elric, who was watching the trees with a grim expression. They both knew that danger was lurking, waiting for the right moment to strike.

As the night wore on, neither Varian nor Elric could find sleep. Memories of past battles and the sense of impending danger kept them awake, their thoughts a whirlwind of fear and determination.

The next morning, a patrol returned with news that sent a shiver down Varian's spine. They had found goblin tracks along the border, indicating a scouting party. The goblins were preparing to attack, and Varian and Elric knew they had to be ready.

Elric quickly ordered the men to sharpen their weapons and remain vigilant. Varian watched as the men set about their tasks, their faces etched with determination. He couldn't help but feel a sense of pride in their bravery, but also a pang of fear. Were they prepared to face the evil lurking in the forest?

As the sun dipped below the horizon once more, casting the outpost in an eerie twilight, Varian looked out at the dark forest. He knew that a great evil was stirring, and he
