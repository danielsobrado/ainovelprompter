Varian and Elric trudged towards the outpost, their boots crunching against the gravel. The weariness etched on their faces was a silent testament to their worries. The wind whispered ominous secrets, making the hairs on their necks stand.

Riders galloped towards them, their faces pale. "Goblins," one of them gasped, "They've killed three cows in the frontier villages. Left the bodies untouched."

Varian's face hardened. He remembered the girl, the terror in her eyes, the unseen attacker. He reported the incident to the village, the words tumbling out of his mouth in a rush.

Captain Aldric's eyes narrowed, his hand tightening around his sword. "Increase the patrols," he ordered, his voice echoing in the stillness, "And search the borders."

Varian and Elric exchanged a glance. The outpost was short-handed. "We need more men," Varian said, his voice steady. Aldric nodded, his face grim. "Recruit from the village."

The outpost buzzed with activity. Varian and Elric checked the defenses, their hands brushing against the cold stone. A dozen men from the village joined them, their faces a mix of fear and determination. Varian assigned them to four-hour shifts with experienced guards, his voice firm and reassuring.

An uneasy calm settled over the outpost. The patrols began, their footsteps echoing in the silence. Varian and Elric stood guard, their eyes scanning the darkness. "Goblin rituals," Varian murmured, his voice barely audible. Elric looked at him, his face unreadable. "Evil lives in the forest," Varian continued, his voice a mere whisper.

A movement in the trees made them freeze. They held their breath, their hearts pounding. A rabbit, its eyes wide with fear, scampered out. Varian let out a sigh, his face still tense. The dark and foreboding nature of the forest unsettled him.

Sleep eluded them, their minds haunted by memories and the sense of impending danger. The next morning, a patrol reported goblin tracks along the border. "A scouting party," Elric murmured, his face grim.

Varian's face hardened. They were preparing to attack. He looked at the men, their faces a mix of fear and determination. "Sharpen your weapons," he ordered, his voice echoing in the stillness.

He looked at the farmers, their faces a silent testament to their courage or foolishness. They lived near the evil forest, their lives a constant dance with danger. He feared that a great evil was stirring in goblin territory.

Elric looked at him, his face unreadable. "We will stand against it," he said, his voice steady. An atmosphere of nervous energy and anticipation permeated the outpost. The men were ready. They would defend. They would fight.
