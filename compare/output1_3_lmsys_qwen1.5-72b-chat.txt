Varian trudged alongside Elric, their worn boots crunching gravel as they approached the frontier outpost. Both men bore the fatigue of recent days etched on their faces, their minds preoccupied with the unsettling news they'd heard from riders.

"Goblins, huh?" Elric muttered, his voice a low growl, betraying his worry. "Killing cows but not taking them? That's not like them."

Varian nodded, the weight of his decision to report a recent village attack heavy on his shoulders. "A girl was attacked, but no sign of who did it. Captain Aldric needs to know."

At the outpost, Captain Aldric listened intently, his grizzled face creased with concern. "We'll double our patrols and comb the borders," he declared, his voice firm but weary. "But stay out of goblin territory. Watch, guard, and report."

Varian and Elric inspected the outpost's defenses, the wooden walls weathered and in need of repair. They gathered a dozen willing villagers, assigning them to shifts alongside seasoned guards. Varian's authority was evident as he instructed the recruits, his voice steady and commanding.

The night fell, casting long shadows across the outpost. Varian and Elric patrolled the perimeter, their torches flickering in the gloom. They exchanged tales of goblin rituals, with Varian's voice tinged with unease. "Something evil lurks in those woods," he whispered.

A rustling in the underbrush made them jump, but it was only a startled rabbit. The false alarm did little to soothe Varian's nerves. The forest seemed to leer at them, its darkness pregnant with unseen threats.

Morning brought a patrol's report of goblin tracks near the border. Varian's heart raced as he realized the stakes: a scouting party, a prelude to war. Elric barked orders, his voice crisp and determined. "Sharpen weapons, men! Stay sharp!"

Varian's thoughts drifted to the farmers living on the edge of the forest. Were they brave or foolhardy? He couldn't shake the feeling that an ancient, malevolent force was awakening.

Elric placed a reassuring hand on Varian's shoulder. "We'll face whatever comes," he vowed, his gaze steady. "Together."

Anxiety hung in the air like a palpable mist, as the men went about their tasks with a newfound urgency. The outpost hummed with anticipation, each man knowing that the next hours could determine their fate.

In the face of uncertainty, Varian and Elric stood resolute, their determination as much a beacon as the watchtowers guarding the outpost's perimeter. As the sun climbed higher, the goblin threat loomed larger, and the men readied themselves for the battle that was surely coming.
