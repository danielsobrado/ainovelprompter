Varian and Elric trudged towards the outpost, their faces etched with exhaustion. Recent events had left them on edge, their minds a whirl of uncertainty.

At the outpost, riders from the frontier villages brought grim news. Goblins had struck again, this time slaughtering three cows. The bodies were left untouched, a chilling deviation from the goblins' usual scavenging habits. Varian's throat tightened as he recalled the recent attack on a village girl, the assailant vanishing without a trace.

Captain Aldric, a man of stern demeanor and iron-gray hair, listened to the reports. His eyes hardened, reflecting the gravity of the situation. He barked out orders, increasing patrols and directing a search of the borders. Varian and Elric exchanged a glance, their concern deepening. The outpost was already short-handed.

Aldric, reading their minds, decided to recruit from the village. "Remember," he warned, his voice a low rumble, "do not enter goblin territory. Watch and guard."

Varian and Elric nodded, their faces solemn. They inspected the outpost's defenses, finding solace in the solidity of the walls. A dozen men from the village joined them, their faces a mix of fear and determination. Varian assigned them to four-hour shifts, pairing them with experienced guards.

An uneasy calm descended as the patrols began. Varian and Elric, on their watch, whispered about goblin rituals. Varian's gaze lingered on the forest, its darkness a palpable entity. "Evil lives there," he murmured, his voice barely audible.

A sudden movement in the trees made them stiffen. But it was just a rabbit, its eyes wide with fear. Varian's heart pounded, the forest's foreboding nature unsettling him.

Sleep was a distant dream that night. Memories of past attacks and the sense of impending danger kept them awake. The next morning, a patrol reported goblin tracks along the border, a clear sign of a scouting party.

Varian and Elric exchanged a look. The goblins were preparing to attack. They had to be ready. Elric ordered the men to sharpen their weapons, his voice steady and reassuring.

Varian, standing alone, looked at the farmers' fields near the forest. He wondered about their courage, or was it foolishness? A chill ran down his spine. A great evil was stirring in the goblin territory.

Elric, noticing his friend's unease, clapped a hand on his shoulder. "We'll stand against whatever comes, Varian," he said, his voice firm.

A sense of nervous energy pervaded the outpost. The men, their faces grim, prepared for the impending attack. The outpost, once a beacon of safety, was now a fortress on the brink of war. And Varian, Elric, and the men were the only thing standing between the village and the darkness of the forest.
