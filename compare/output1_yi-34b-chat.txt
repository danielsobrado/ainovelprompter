The sun dipped below the horizon, casting elongated shadows on the well-trodden path as Varian and Elric trudged towards the outpost. Their faces bore the weariness of the day's arduous journey, yet their eyes reflected a deeper concern. A sense of urgency hung in the air, an unspoken fear they both shared.

Upon reaching the outpost, they learned from the riders that goblins had attacked frontier villages, striking down three cows without taking the bodies. The news sent a chill down their spines. Varian reported the incident in the village where a girl had been attacked, but no trace of the attacker had been found.

Captain Aldric, a seasoned warrior with a stern gaze, listened intently. He understood the gravity of the situation and immediately ordered increased patrols and a thorough search of the borders. "We can't let our guard down," he emphasized, his voice heavy with determination.

Varian and Elric exchanged worried glances. The outpost was already short-handed, and they voiced their concerns. "We're stretched thin as it is," Elric pointed out. Aldric nodded, acknowledging the predicament. "We'll recruit men from the village. They're tough and loyal. It's time to muster all the help we can get."

Aldric turned to Varian and Elric, his eyes hardening. "Remember, you're not to enter goblin territory. Your job is to watch and guard. We need to be ready for anything."

The two friends spent the following hours inspecting the outpost's defenses and gathering a dozen men from the village to help with the patrols. Varian assigned the new recruits to four-hour shifts with experienced guards, ensuring they were well-rested and prepared for any eventuality.

As night fell, an uneasy calm settled over the outpost. The men took their positions, their eyes scanning the dark forest for any signs of movement. Varian and Elric stood side by side, the tension between them palpable. The stories about goblin rituals and the evil that lurked in the forest were never far from their minds.

During their watch, they spotted a movement in the trees. Their hearts pounded in their chests as they gripped their weapons tighter. But as they approached, they found only a scared rabbit, its eyes wide with fear. Varian's heart didn't slow, though. The dark and foreboding nature of the forest still unsettled him.

Sleep eluded them that night. Memories of their past encounters with the goblins and the sense of impending danger kept them awake. The next morning, a patrol reported finding goblin tracks along the border, indicating a scouting party. Varian and Elric looked at each other, their faces grim. The goblins were preparing to attack, and they had to be ready.

Elric rallied the men, ordering them to sharpen their weapons and remain vigilant. Varian couldn't help but wonder about the bravery or foolishness of the farmers who lived near the evil forest. He feared that a great evil was stirring in goblin territory.

Elric noticed the worry etched on Varian's face. He placed a comforting hand on his friend's shoulder. "We'll stand against whatever threat emerges from those trees, Varian. We're not alone in this."

The atmosphere at the outpost was tense, a nervous energy pulsating through the men as they prepared for the impending goblin attack. The stakes were high, and they knew they had to be ready.
