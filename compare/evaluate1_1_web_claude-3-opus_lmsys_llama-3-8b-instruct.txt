Here are some areas where the fantasy text could be enhanced to align with the standards of commercial fantasy novels:
Character Development:

Provide more background and depth to the main characters Varian and Elric. What motivates them? What are their fears, hopes, and flaws? Helping readers connect emotionally with the protagonists would strengthen the narrative.
Introduce more distinct personalities and roles for the secondary characters like Captain Aldric and the riders. Fleshing them out, even briefly, would make the story feel more vibrant and populated.

World-Building:

The setting could benefit from more vivid, sensory details to fully immerse the reader. Describe the sights, sounds, smells and textures of the landscape, outpost, and evil forest.
Provide more context about the larger world, its history, politics, magic system, and the relationships between humans, goblins and other races. This would give readers a better grasp of the stakes and scope.

Pacing & Narrative Structure:

The pacing feels a bit rushed, jumping from scene to scene without much transition or time for events to breathe and develop. Balancing action with quieter moments of character interaction and reflection would improve the flow.
Consider employing more classic story structure, with clear inciting incidents, rising action, a climax and resolution. Foreshadowing the growing threat more strategically could build anticipation.

Prose & Readability:

The prose is generally clear and easy to follow. However, varying sentence lengths and structures would create a more dynamic reading experience.
Punching up the descriptions with creative metaphors, analogies and sensory details would make the environments and characters more memorable and impactful.

Themes & Tone:

Classic fantasy motifs of good vs. evil, an impending dark power, and a hero's journey are present but could be explored in more depth and nuance to avoid cliches.
The overall tone is fairly consistent - ominous and gritty. Injecting more contrasting moments of warmth, humor or beauty could make the dark elements stand out more.

Positive Aspects:

Engaging opening that drops readers right into an intriguing scenario
Clear conflict established with the goblin attacks and looming evil
Hints of a richly developed fantasy world with magic, different races and political structures

Areas for Improvement:

Protagonists and secondary characters need more depth and distinct voices
Pacing feels uneven, rushing through some scenes without letting moments land emotionally
More sensory details and context needed to fully immerse readers in the world
Some awkward phrasings and excessive adverbs weaken the prose

With some revision to develop the characters, deepen the world-building, modulate the pacing, and refine the prose, this story could become a more impactful and immersive fantasy tale that connects with readers both intellectually and emotionally. The bones of an engaging narrative are already in place.
