Varian and Elric trudged towards the outpost, their footsteps heavy with fatigue and worry. The path ahead, a winding track through the dense forest, seemed endless. Varian glanced at Elric, whose furrowed brow mirrored his own concerns.

"We can't keep this pace," Elric said, breaking the silence. "We need to find out what's happening before it's too late."

As they neared the outpost, riders galloped towards them, dust kicking up in their wake. One of the riders reined in his horse and dismounted. "Varian, Elric, you're needed immediately. Goblins have killed three cows in the frontier villages. They didn't take the bodies."

Varian frowned. "That's unusual. Goblins don't waste meat."

Elric nodded. "Something's changed."

They entered the outpost and headed straight for Captain Aldric's quarters. The captain, a burly man with a stern face, looked up from his maps. "Varian, Elric, what news?"

Varian stepped forward. "A girl was attacked in the village. No attacker found. Just like the cows."

Aldric's expression darkened. "This is more serious than we thought. We'll need to increase patrols and search the borders."

Elric spoke up. "We're short-handed, Captain. We need more men."

Aldric sighed. "I'll recruit from the village. But listen, do not enter goblin territory. Watch and guard only."

Varian and Elric left Aldric's quarters and inspected the outpost's defenses. The wooden palisade stood firm, but the tension in the air was palpable. Varian turned to Elric. "We need to

gather men from the village and set up patrols. We can't afford any lapses."

Elric nodded. "Let's get to it. We'll need every able-bodied man."

They walked to the village square, calling for volunteers. A dozen men stepped forward, their faces a mix of determination and fear. Varian quickly assigned them to four-hour shifts with experienced guards. The outpost buzzed with an uneasy calm as the new recruits took their positions and patrols began.

Later that evening, Varian and Elric stood watch together, the forest looming dark and silent before them. The crackling of the campfire seemed loud in the stillness. Elric broke the silence. "I've heard stories about goblin rituals. They say evil lives in that forest."

Varian shook his head. "I've always felt something off about those woods. It's like they're watching us."

Suddenly, there was movement in the trees. Both men tensed, weapons at the ready. A small, frightened rabbit darted out, and they exhaled in unison, relaxing slightly.

Elric laughed nervously. "A rabbit. We're jumping at shadows."

Varian's eyes remained on the forest. "Shadows or not, something's out there. We need to stay alert."

They tried to sleep that night, but rest eluded them. Varian tossed and turned, haunted by memories and an ever-growing sense of dread. Elric's restless shifting nearby told him he wasn't the only one struggling.
