Varian and Elric trudged wearily along the dirt path that led to the outpost. Their boots thumped in time with their beating hearts, a rhythmic reminder of their anxiety. The sun was setting, casting long shadows across the landscape as it disappeared behind the distant mountains.

"We need to hurry," Elric urged, his voice tight with tension. "If those reports are true..."

Varian nodded, his jaw set in determination. "We'll find out soon enough."

As they approached the gates of the outpost, they were met by a pair of weary riders who had just returned from their patrol. The horses snorted and pawed at the ground, sensing the urgency in their riders.

"What news?" Varian called out.

One rider dismounted with an air of exhaustion. "Three cows slaughtered in the frontier," he reported tersely. "No sign of who did it."

Elric frowned, his hand resting on the hilt of his sword. "That's not like goblins."

"No, it isn't," Varian agreed grimly. "They usually take their kills with them."

Their conversation was cut short as Captain Aldric emerged from within the wooden walls. He was a tall, broad-shouldered man with eyes that had seen too much. His expression was serious as he listened to the riders' report.

"Bring me the details," he said, his voice low and commanding. "In my office."

Once inside, Varian relayed his own information about the girl who was attacked in her village. The room grew silent as the gravity of the situation sank in.

Captain Aldric leaned back in his chair, stroking his beard thoughtfully. "This is serious," he said at last. "We need to bolster our defenses immediately."

"But we're short-handed," Elric pointed out.

Aldric nodded. "I know. That's why I'm ordering increased patrols and a search of the borders." He looked directly at Varian and Elric. "And I'll be recruiting men from the village to help."

The friends exchanged glances, understanding the weight of the decision. They had both seen what happened when an outpost was overrun by goblins before.

"We're with you," Varian said firmly.

Elric nodded. "Let's get to it."

The captain leaned forward, his gaze intense. "Remember, do not enter goblin territory. We're here to watch and guard, not to provoke."

They set to work immediately, checking the outpost's defenses and gathering a group of villagers willing to help. Twelve men stepped forward, their faces a mix of fear and resolve.

"Good," Varian said, slapping one on the back. "You'll be doing four-hour shifts with our experienced guards."

The night air was thick with tension as they patrolled the outskirts of the outpost. The forest loomed before them, a mass of inky blackness that seemed to pulse with malevolent energy. They whispered to one another, sharing stories of goblin rituals and the creatures' insatiable hunger for blood.

"I don't like it," Varian murmured as he stared into the trees. "The dark whispers of something wicked."

Elric nodded but kept his voice steady. "We've faced worse, my friend. We'll stand together against whatever comes for us."

As the night wore on, an uneasy calm settled over the outpost. The men tried to rest between their shifts, but sleep was elusive. Dreams of monstrous faces and glowing eyes haunted them.

The next morning brought no relief. A patrol returned with reports of goblin tracks along the border. It was clear that a scouting party had been there, preparing for an attack.

"We must be ready," Elric said, his voice echoing across the gathering crowd. "Sharpen your weapons and keep your eyes open."

Varian couldn't shake off his unease as he surveyed the men. The farmers who had chosen to live so close to the forest were either brave or foolish, but they were all that stood between civilization and chaos. He hoped their bravery would be enough.

Throughout the day, the mood grew tenser. Every snap of a twig or rustle of leaves sent hearts racing. They knew the attack was coming; it was just a matter of when.

As dusk fell again, the forest seemed to hold its breath. The air was charged with anticipation as they took up their positions, ready to defend their home.

Varian turned to Elric, his eyes reflecting the flickering torchlight. "Are we doing enough?"

Elric clapped him on the shoulder. "We'll find out soon."

And with that, they waited, each man lost in his own thoughts as darkness closed in around them.
