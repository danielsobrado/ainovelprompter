Varian and Elric trudged through the dust of the well-worn path, their boots kicking up a cloud that followed them like a silent, gritty companion. The sun beat down on their shoulders, but it was a weary, half-hearted warmth, as if the very light of day was growing weary of chasing the shadows that seemed to be lengthening across the land.

The two friends had been friends since childhood, and in the years since, they'd faced their fair share of trials, but something about the air that hung heavy over the countryside now had them both on edge. Varian, with his steady gaze and the hint of a scar on his chin, could feel it in his bones—a prickling sense of danger that he couldn't quite put his finger on. Elric, with his easy grin and hands that had seen too much blood for a man his age, shared the same premonition.

"You think it's them?" Elric asked, his voice carrying just enough doubt to betray his uncertainty.

Varian nodded, his expression grim. "Alden's riders confirmed it. Goblins. Three cows taken, butchered, and left to rot in the fields."

Elric whistled low. "That's... bold, even for them."

They fell silent, their minds filled with the same grim thoughts—goblins meant trouble, and lots of it. The creatures were as cunning as they were cruel, and their presence usually heralded darker things to come.

The outpost loomed ahead, a collection of squat stone buildings with slitted windows that watched them like unblinking eyes. Captain Aldric was waiting for them, his stance rigid, his eyes scanning the horizon as if expecting an attack at any moment.

"Riders came in just as you were leaving. Goblins have been seen along the frontier," Aldric said, his voice little more than a growl. "And they're not just raiding. They're killing without taking."

Varian felt a chill run down his spine. "That's not like them. What are they up to?"

Aldric shook his head. "We'll find out soon enough. In the meantime, we need to be ready."

The air crackled with tension as the three men discussed the situation, the urgency clear in their clipped exchanges. Varian reported on the incident in the village, where a young girl had been attacked, but no sign of the assailant could be found. Aldric listened, his face a mask of stone, and then issued orders with the precision of a commander who knew the weight of his decisions.

"Increase patrols. Search the borders. And let's not forget, we're short-handed as it is," he said, his gaze flicking between Varian and Elric.

Varian nodded. "I'll gather some men from the village. They may not be soldiers, but they know these lands."

Elric stepped forward. "And I'll check the defenses. Make sure we're not caught unawares."

Aldric nodded, his approval clear. "Good. Make it quick. We don't have much time before nightfall."

The sun dipped lower, its light turning the sky a tangerine hue that seemed to bleed into the deepening shadows of the forest. Goblin's Wood, the dark heart of these lands, loomed on the edge of the outpost's vision, a silent sentinel that no one dared approach.

Varian and Elric worked quickly, the rhythm of their tasks mirroring the steady drumbeat of their worry. They organized the new recruits, a motley crew of farmers and traders who had answered the call to arms with varying degrees of enthusiasm, but all with the same determination to defend their homes.

"You two know the drill," Varian said, his voice carrying over the clang of steel as the men sharpened their weapons. "Four-hour shifts, patrolling the borders. We watch, we guard. We don't go into the forest."

The men nodded, their faces etched with a mix of fear and resolve. They knew the stories of Goblin's Wood, the whispered tales of dark magic and worse horrors that lay within its shadowy embrace.

As the night drew in, the outpost became a beacon of light against the encroaching darkness, a defiant stand against the unknown. Varian and Elric took their places on the wall, their eyes scanning the treeline for any sign of movement.
