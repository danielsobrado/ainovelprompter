Varian and Elric trudged towards the outpost, their faces etched with fatigue and worry. The recent string of unsettling events had left them on edge.

"Goblins, Elric," Varian said, his voice barely above a whisper. "They've killed three cows in frontier villages. But they didn't take the bodies. It's as if they're hiding something."

Elric nodded, his brow furrowed. "And there's more," he added. "A girl was attacked in one of the villages. But no one saw the attacker. It's like they're playing a game with us."

Back at the outpost, Captain Aldric listened to their report. His face hardened. "We need to act," he said, his voice firm. "Increase patrols. Search the borders. We can't let them roam free."

Varian looked at Aldric, concern etched on his face. "But Captain," he said, "our outpost is short-handed. We're stretched thin as it is."

Aldric met his gaze. "Then we'll recruit men from the village," he said. "We need all the help we can get."

Varian nodded, understanding the gravity of the situation. "But we must be careful," he warned. "We can't go into goblin territory. We can only watch, guard."

The next day, Varian and Elric, along with the newly recruited men, checked the outpost's defenses. The men worked tirelessly, their faces grim under the harsh sun. Varian assigned the new recruits to four-hour shifts, their faces reflecting a mix of determination and fear.

As the patrols began, an uneasy calm settled over the outpost. The men moved with a sense of urgency, their eyes scanning the horizon for any sign of danger.

Later, as they sat around the fire, Varian and Elric discussed the stories they'd heard about goblin rituals. "Evil lives in the forest," Varian said, his voice low. "I fear what they might be planning."

That night, as they lay in their beds, Varian and Elric struggled to sleep. The forest outside their window seemed to come alive, its dark silhouette a stark contrast against the moonlit sky. Memories of past events and the sense of impending danger haunted them.

The next morning, a patrol reported finding goblin tracks along the border. The men exchanged worried glances. "They're scouting," Elric said, his voice barely audible. "They're preparing to attack."

Varian nodded, his face grim. "We must be ready," he said. "We must stand against whatever threat emerges from the forest."

As the men prepared for the impending attack, an atmosphere of nervous energy and anticipation permeated the outpost. The forest outside seemed to grow darker, its foreboding presence a constant reminder of the danger that lurked within.
