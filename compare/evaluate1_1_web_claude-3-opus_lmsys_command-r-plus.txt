Here are some suggestions for enhancing this fantasy text to align with the standards of commercial fantasy novels:
Character Development:

Provide more insight into Varian and Elric's backgrounds, motivations, and inner conflicts. What drives them? What are their strengths and flaws?
Show how the growing goblin threat impacts them emotionally and psychologically. Do they have any personal stakes in this conflict?
Introduce more distinct traits, mannerisms or speech patterns to make the characters feel more unique and memorable.

World-Building:

Offer more vivid descriptions of the setting - the outpost, the surrounding lands, the frontier villages. Paint a picture that immerses the reader in this fantasy world.
Share intriguing details about the goblins to make them feel like a fully-realized fantasy race, not just generic monsters. What is unique about their culture, magic, or way of life?
Hint at a deeper history and lore behind this conflict. Are there ancient prophecies, legendary heroes, or significant past events that tie into the current goblin threat?

Pacing and Narrative Structure:

The pacing feels a bit rushed, jumping from scene to scene without much room for the story to breathe. Consider expanding key moments with more description, dialogue and character reactions.
The structure is fairly linear - consider employing fantasy-genre techniques like starting in media res, utilizing flashbacks, or weaving in subplots to create a more complex, intriguing narrative.
End sections with stronger hooks and cliffhangers to compel the reader onward. The current section endings are a little flat.

Prose and Style:

The writing is clear and easy to follow, but could use more sensory details and vivid imagery to fully transport the reader. Describe sights, sounds, smells, textures.
Some of the dialogue feels a tad generic or on-the-nose. Aim for more subtext, distinctive voices, and lines that do more than one thing at a time (reveal character, advance plot, set tone, etc).
Vary sentence structures and lengths. The abundance of short, declarative sentences gives it a somewhat simplistic feel. Weave in more complex phrases and figurative language.

Handling of Fantasy Tropes:

Classic fantasy races like goblins and motifs like ancient evil are present, but not yet given a unique spin. What fresh take can you offer?
The outpost under siege by monsters is a familiar fantasy scenario. Consider subverting expectations in how it unfolds.
Themes of good vs evil and holding darkness at bay are touched upon but could be explored with more depth and nuance. Tie them more integrally into character arcs and struggles.

Tone and Voice:

The grim, ominous tone is established well, but occasionally veers into melodrama with on-the-nose lines like "I fear evil lives in that forest". Aim for more subtlety.
Opportunities for more wit, humor or unique narratorial personality to balance the dark tone.
Some inconsistency in how formal/archaic the language is. Pick a clear voice and stick with it.

Positive Points:

Compelling setup with rising action of a goblin threat
Well-structured scenes with clear goals and conflicts
Effectively builds an ominous, portentous atmosphere
Easy to follow writing with a brisk, propulsive pace

Areas for Improvement:

Characters and world need more depth and detail to feel vivid
Prose is workmanlike but lacks artistry and grace
Plot beats and fantasy elements are a bit generic/familiar
Emotional impact and reader investment could be stronger

With some refinement, this could be elevated from a functionally told tale to a truly engaging, evocative and emotionally immersive fantasy story. The key is adding more layers - to the characters, the world, the plot, the prose - while staying true to your voice and vision. Keep at it!
