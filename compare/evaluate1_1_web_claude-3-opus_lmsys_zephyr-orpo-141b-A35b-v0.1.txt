Here are some thoughts on how this fantasy text could be enhanced to align with the standards of commercial fantasy novels:
Character Development:

Varian and Elric's personalities could be fleshed out more to make them distinctive. What are their backstories, motivations, flaws? Giving them clearer character arcs would make them more compelling.
The villagers and other guards are mostly faceless at the moment. Introducing a few named supporting characters with their own mini-arcs could add depth.
Captain Aldric comes across as a bit of a clich√© grizzled commander. Giving him some unique attributes or a surprising element to his character could make him more memorable.

World-Building:

The world feels generic so far - a standard pseudo-medieval setting with humans vs goblins. More specificity and unique details about the cultures, magic system, history, etc. would make it richer and set it apart.
The goblin threat and "evil in the forest" are vague. Hinting more at the specific nature of the darkness lurking there would build a greater sense of dread and foreboding.
Descriptions of the environment like the outpost, village, and plains could be more vivid and give a stronger sense of place.

Pacing & Structure:

The pacing is a bit uneven, with some sections rushing through events and others dwelling on small moments. Balancing the rhythm better would improve flow.
There aren't clear short-term and long-term story goals driving the narrative yet, beyond the vague goblin threat. Establishing concrete stakes and a focused storyline would give the tale more momentum.
The ending is abrupt and feels unfinished, more like the end of a chapter than a complete short story. Developing a more impactful conclusion would be beneficial.

Prose & Readability:

The prose is generally solid and readable but a bit plain. Using more evocative and specific word choices could better immerse the reader in the world and characters' emotional states.
Some of the dialogue tags are overwritten (e.g. "Varian muttered, his breath fogging the frosty air", "Elric commanded"). Simplifying these would improve the flow of conversation.
Varying the sentence structures more and including some snappier fragments could give the writing more punch and urgency in tense moments.

Tone, Theme & Voice:

The ominous tone and themes of lurking evil and dread are promising but could be developed further to be truly gripping. Eerie details, a more visceral sense of increasing danger.
Varian's certainty about the evil in the forest suggests potential themes to explore - cost of fighting darkness, psychological toll of vigilance, nature of true evil, etc. Thoughtful thematic underpinnings would give the story more meaning and resonance.
The narrative voice is fairly distant/omniscient. Using a closer or more colorful POV voice could pull the reader in more strongly.

Some positives:

Creates an overall intriguing, ominous atmosphere
Action-focused plot keeps things moving
Glimmers of compelling character dynamics between Varian and Elric
Solid bones of classic fantasy setup to build on

Some negatives:

Characters and world feel underdeveloped so far
Pacing and structure need focus and variation
Prose is readable but plain
Themes and voice not as strong as they could be

With some development in the areas above, this could shape into an engaging fantasy tale. The seeds of compelling elements are certainly there as a starting point. Focusing on specificity, a driving storyline, and creating a vivid sense of a unique world and characters will really bring it to life. With revision and expansion, this could align well with the expectations of fantasy readers.
