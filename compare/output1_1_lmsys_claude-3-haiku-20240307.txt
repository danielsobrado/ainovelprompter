Varian and Elric trudged through the muddy path, their boots sinking into the soft earth. The air was thick with the scent of damp foliage, and the canopy of ancient trees cast long shadows over the winding trail.

"I don't like this, Elric," Varian said, his brow furrowed. "The forest feels...unsettled."

Elric nodded, his gaze scanning the surrounding woods. "Aye, there's a chill in the air. Something's not right."

They pressed on, their pace quickening as they neared the outpost. The sound of hooves drew their attention, and they watched as a pair of mounted riders emerged from the gloom.

"Halt!" called one of the riders, reining in his horse. "State your business."

Varian stepped forward. "We're from the village, returning to the outpost. What news do you bring?"

The rider grimaced. "Goblins have been raiding the frontier settlements. Three cows taken, but the bodies left behind. Strange doings."

Varian's eyes widened. "Goblins? Have there been any attacks on the people?"

"Just last night, a girl was set upon near the edge of the forest. But no attacker was found." The rider shook his head. "Captain Aldric will want to hear of this."

Without another word, the riders spurred their horses and disappeared down the trail.

Varian turned to Elric, his expression grave. "We must warn the captain at once."

They hurried to the outpost, the imposing wooden walls a welcome sight. A sentry hailed them from the ramparts.

"Open the gates!" Varian called. "We have news for Captain Aldric."

The heavy wooden doors creaked open, and they passed through into the bustling courtyard. Varian spotted the captain overseeing a group of recruits, their faces set with determination.

"Captain Aldric!" Varian strode towards him, Elric at his side. "We've just heard troubling news from the riders."

Aldric raised a hand, his weathered face etched with concern. "Speak, then. What have you learned?"

Varian relayed the information about the goblin raids and the attack on the girl. "The frontier villages are in danger, Captain. We must act quickly."

Aldric's brow furrowed. "Goblins, you say? This is no mere raiding party, then." He turned to the recruits, barking orders. "Double the patrols along the border! I want every inch of that forest watched."

The men scrambled to their tasks, their faces tense with apprehension.

Varian stepped forward. "Captain, we're already short-handed as it is. How can we hope to defend the outpost and the villages?"

Aldric's gaze hardened. "We'll recruit more men from the village. I'll not have these goblins terrorizing our people." He fixed Varian with a stern look. "And you two will stay here, guarding the outpost. I won't have you venturing into goblin territory. Understood?"

Varian nodded reluctantly. "Understood, Captain."

As Aldric strode away to oversee the preparations, Elric turned to Varian. "This doesn't bode well, my friend. The goblins are becoming bolder."

Varian's jaw tightened. "Aye, and I fear there's more to this than simple raiding. Something dark stirs in the forest."

They set about reinforcing the outpost's defenses, checking the stockpile of weapons and supplies. Soon, a group of villagers arrived, their faces etched with a mixture of fear and determination.

Varian addressed them, his voice firm. "Welcome, friends. We need your help to defend our homes. You'll be divided into four-hour shifts, patrolling the borders with our experienced guards."

The villagers nodded, their hands tightening around the spears and axes they carried. Varian assigned them to their posts, watching as they took up their positions along the walls and in the surrounding woods.

An uneasy calm settled over the outpost as the patrols began. Varian and Elric stood together, their gaze fixed on the dark forest beyond the gates.

"Do you remember
