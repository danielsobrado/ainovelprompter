Varian's heavy footsteps echoed alongside Elric's lighter ones as they approached the outpost, exhaustion weighing their shoulders down. Worry lines etched on both faces, their breaths visible in the chilly night air. A pair of riders clattered into sight, interrupting the silence with urgent news: goblins had struck three frontier villages, leaving behind dead cows but no bodies.

Entering Captain Aldric's chamber, they relayed the grim tidings. The captain, a stout man with gray whiskers and eyes that held untold stories, listened intently before standing abruptly. "This is no raiding party," he growled, fingers drumming on his solid wood desk. "We're dealing with something far more sinister." He ordered immediate increased patrols around the border.

"What about the village where the girl was attacked?" Varian asked, remembering the terror-stricken child's face.

Aldric nodded solemnly. "I'll send a group there too. But we can't spare many men; our numbers are thin."

Varian and Elric exchanged glances. They knew their home was vulnerable, but the outpost had to come first. It was the only thing keeping the goblins at bay.

"We could recruit from the village," Elric suggested quietly.

The captain hesitated before agreeing reluctantly. "Be careful who you choose."

With grim determination, they rallied a dozen villagers and assigned them to patrols in groups of four with experienced guards. The newcomers looked terrified but resolute as Varian explained their duties during the briefing: watch and guard, not engage unless necessary.

Checking the outpost's defenses, they found it woefully insufficient against an organized assault. Walls were crumbling in places, watchtowers barely manned. Aldric's warning about not entering goblin territory lingered in their minds like a dark cloud.

As night fell again, the outpost was tense with anticipation. Men whispered fearful rumors around smoky campfires while others prayed silently to forgotten gods. Varian assigned shifts, his voice firm but strained with worry.

During their watch, the darkness pressed against them like a living thing. Every rustling leaf or cracking twig made their hearts leap. Once, Varian thought he saw eyes gleaming in the underbrush; Elric's grip tightened on his sword-hilt as they peered into the gloom together. A scared rabbit bolted out from the bushes and dashed past them, its white tail disappearing swiftly into the night. They let out relieved breaths but remained alert.

"Why would they kill without taking anything?" Elric wondered aloud, staring after the retreating animal.

Varian's face hardened. "Rituals maybe? I heard stories..." He trailed off, lost in thought.

Elric sighed heavily. "Let's hope it's just that."

Sleep eluded them both that night, their dreams filled with images of goblins lurking just beyond the firelight. The forest seemed to grow darker and more menacing by the minute, its secrets whispering threats in their ears.

At dawn, a patrol returned, mud-splattered and breathless. They'd found goblin tracks along the border â€“ fresh ones, heading back into the trees. The outpost sprang to life with renewed urgency as men sharpened weapons and checked armor straps, eyes darting towards the forest edge where danger seemed imminent.

Varian couldn't help but think of those brave or foolish farmers who lived so close to this evil. Did they hear it too? The unspoken promise of violence? He prayed for their safety even as he prepared to protect his own people.

Elric sensed Varian's fear and clapped him on the back, his voice steady despite his own doubts. "We've fought worse things together, old friend."

"Yes," Varian agreed, squaring his shoulders. "But I fear something wakes in those woods, something far greater than goblins..."

Throughout the day, tension coiled tighter around the outpost like a serpent ready to strike. Everyone knew what nightfall could bring: an answer to their unspoken questions or death at clawed hands. But they stood ready, forged by duty and friendship, unwilling to let evil consume their land without a fight.
