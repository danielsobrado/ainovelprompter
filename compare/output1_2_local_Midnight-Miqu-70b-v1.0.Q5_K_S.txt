Varian's boots crunched on the gravel as he trudged alongside Elric towards the outpost, the weight of their recent discoveries pressing heavily upon them. Shadows stretched long across the path, nightfall looming ever nearer. Exhaustion etched lines into their faces; even Elric's usually boundless energy seemed subdued.

Reaching the wooden gate, they passed the tired guards exchanging weary nods before entering the bustling compound. The smell of cooking fires mingled with leather and sweat in the chilly air. Tension thrummed underneath their voices as riders returned from patrols, sharing whispers about goblin attacks on border villages. Three cows slain without a trace, just left to rot where they fell.

"Captain Aldric needs to hear this," Varian said, his jaw set grimly. His hand clenched around the report he'd written during their journey - a girl attacked near the forest edge, no sign of the attacker except strange footprints too small for any man or beast known to roam these lands.

Elric nodded, his eyes scanning the outpost. "Agreed."

They found Aldric in his quarters pouring over maps and scrolls, deep lines carved into his forehead as he strategized. Upon hearing their news, his face paled. He looked up from the parchment, eyes sharp.

"We're short-handed," Varian noted, breaking the heavy silence that followed. "But we can get men from the village to help."

Aldric sighed, rubbing a hand over his salt and pepper beard. He hesitated before agreeing, "Aye, do it. We need all hands on deck."

The captain's usually hearty voice was brittle with worry. Varian understood; they were already stretched thin protecting the frontier. This sudden escalation of violence could mean only one thing: an impending goblin incursion.

"But remember," Aldric warned them both, "do not enter goblin territory. Watch and guard, that's all."

Varian nodded stiffly, understanding the unspoken truth: they were not to provoke a fight unless absolutely necessary. Their priority was protecting human lives, even if it meant letting the vile creatures retreat into their dark homes.

The two friends ventured into the village under the guise of night, rallying able-bodied men who would listen. They returned with a dozen volunteers, eyes wide but determined beneath the flickering torchlight. Varian assigned them to four-hour shifts alongside experienced guards, hoping their presence would bolster morale and strengthen defenses.

The outpost was a flurry of activity as they checked weapons, fortified walls, and prepared for the worst. Yet beneath it all lay a tense quiet, broken only by occasional nervous laughter or hushed prayers to long-forgotten gods. The forest loomed over them like a silent predator waiting to pounce at any moment.

As Varian paced along the battlements during his watch, he couldn't shake off thoughts of the evil lurking just beyond sight. He glanced at Elric, standing rigid beside him, and wondered if his friend shared the same dread.

"Why do they live so close?" he finally asked, voice low enough not to carry. "The farmers, I mean."

Elric shrugged. "Brave or foolish, maybe." His tone was even, but there was an edge to it that betrayed his own anxiety.

Varian snorted softly, gaze lingering on the inky expanse of trees. "Or desperate."

They fell into a contemplative silence until Elric broke it with another question: "Do you believe those stories? About goblin rituals?"

"What choice do we have?" Varian replied solemnly, eyes never leaving the forest. "Evil lives there; that much is certain."

A twig snapped in the darkness below. Both men tensed, hands reaching for their swords before a small brown rabbit darted out from undergrowth and scampered away. They shared a relieved chuckle but said nothing more as they continued to stare into the unknown.

Sleep eluded them both when their shift ended. Tossing on their cots, memories of past battles haunted Varian's dreams while Elric lay awake, mind racing with possible strategies should the goblins attack.

Morning came too soon, bringing with it news that sent a shiver down every spine in the outpost - goblin tracks had been found along the border. Scouting party, most likely. The enemy was close and getting closer.

Elric barked orders, his normally calm demeanor replaced by an urgent intensity. Men scrambled to sharpen weapons, adjust armor, and gather supplies. Their laughter now replaced with grim determination.

Varian watched them, heart heavy in his chest. He knew the dangers lurking within those trees better than most. Yet, he couldn't help but admire their courage - or perhaps it was foolishness? Either way, they stood ready to face whatever horrors emerged from the shadows.

His thoughts were interrupted by a soft knock on the doorframe. One of the new recruits, Thomas, shifted his weight nervously. "Sir... my wife..." His voice trailed off as he swallowed hard.

"She'll be safe," Varian lied, forcing confidence into his tone. He clapped a reassuring hand on the man's shoulder, silently praying it was true.

Thomas nodded once before disappearing back into the sea of preparations. Varian turned away, stomach knotting at the sight of so many lives entrusted to him and Elric.

The day dragged on in a blur of activity punctuated by moments of gut-wrenching stillness where even breathing seemed too loud. Just as dusk began painting the sky with its somber hues, Captain Aldric called them to his side.

"Boys," he said gravely, "it seems our worst fears are upon us." He held out a crumpled piece of parchment bearing fresh goblin scrawl - a crude map leading straight to the village and the outpost.

Varian swore under his breath as Elric took the note, eyes narrowing in anger. "They're coming," he confirmed, voice cold steel.

"Aye," Aldric agreed, "and we must be ready." He handed them each a sword freshly honed to deadly sharpness. "May fortune favor us tonight."

Together, they stepped outside into the gathering gloom, facing the forest that seemed to breathe malevolence itself. An unspoken resolve passed between them: they would not let this evil claim their home without a fight.
