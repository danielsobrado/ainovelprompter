Here are some suggestions for enhancing this fantasy text to better align with the standards of commercial fantasy novels:
Character Development:

Provide more background and depth to Varian and Elric to make them distinct, relatable protagonists. What motivates them? What unique skills or flaws do they have?
Show more of their inner thoughts, emotions and personal stakes to get readers invested in their journey.
Flesh out Captain Aldric and the villagers with telling details and dialogue that hint at their personalities.

World-building:

The outpost, village of Alden, and surrounding forest could be described in more vivid, specific detail to immerse the reader in the setting. What makes this fantasy world unique?
Expand on the lore, history and nature of the goblins as the central threat. What is known about their origins, capabilities, and the "rituals" and "evil" attributed to them?
Hint at a wider world beyond just this immediate area to create a sense of scope.

Pacing & Structure:

The pacing is a bit uneven, with a slow build-up focused heavily on the outpost defenses, then an abrupt tonal shift to the presence of an imminent, powerful threat.
Consider restructuring to open with a gripping hook, like a glimpse of the strange attacks, to immediately draw readers in. Then weave in the defensive preparations more concisely.
The ending also feels a bit anti-climactic, trailing off without a clear climax or narrative arc. Wrap up this opening sequence with more of a punch - perhaps an initial skirmish with the goblins that sets the stakes.

Prose & Readability:

The prose is fairly solid overall with some vivid descriptions, but a bit over-written in places. Simplify wordy phrases like "his breath forming a frosty cloud with each word he spoke" to "his breath frosting the air as he spoke."
Use more active, punchy verbs. For example: "A rabbit bolted out from the trees, vanishing into the brush" instead of "darted" and "disappearing."
Vary sentence length and structure to create a better flow and cadence.

Tone & Voice:

The grim, ominous tone is atmospheric and appropriate for dark fantasy. However, it could use more texture - brief moments of humor, hope or humanity between Varian and Elric to avoid feeling monotonous.
Give the two protagonists more distinctive voices and personalities. How do they each uniquely view and react to their circumstances? Let that come through in their dialogue and thoughts.

Themes & Motifs:

Classic fantasy themes of good vs. evil, man vs. supernatural, and the hero's journey are all hinted at. However, they could be developed with more nuance and specificity to this story and world.
The creepy, hostile forest is an evocative motif. Consider ways to deepen the symbolism, like paralleling the shadowy threat within it to the fear and doubts lurking in the men's minds as they face the unknown.

Positives:

Atmospheric, ominous tone sets an intriguing dark fantasy mood
Vivid descriptions of settings, action, and characters' physical states
Clearly establishes the central conflict and stakes with the goblin threat
Focuses on relatable theme of bravery vs. fear in the face of darkness

Negatives:

Pacing is uneven, with an abrupt shift in urgency and stakes
Lacks a clear narrative arc or climax in this opening sequence
Prose is over-written in places; could be more concise and punchy
World-building, character development, and themes could be deepened

With some refinement, this text could be shaped into an even more vivid, suspenseful and emotionally resonant fantasy novel opening that better aligns with commercial standards. The bones of an engrossing story are there, but would benefit from further development of the characters, world, and narrative structure. Streamlining the prose and sharpening the pacing would also help hook readers. With those improvements, this could be a very promising start to a dark fantasy adventure.
