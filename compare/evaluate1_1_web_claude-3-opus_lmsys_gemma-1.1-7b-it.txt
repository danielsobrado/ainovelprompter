Here are some suggestions for how this fantasy text could be enhanced to align with the standards of commercial fantasy novels:
Character Development:

Provide more background and depth to the main characters Varian and Elric. What motivates them? What are their fears, hopes, flaws? Readers should feel emotionally invested.
Show character growth over the course of the story. How do the events impact and change Varian and Elric?
Introduce more nuance and shades of gray to characters like Captain Aldric. Avoid making them feel one-dimensional.

World-Building:

Expand descriptions of the setting to make the world feel richer and more immersive. What makes this fantasy realm unique?
Provide more context around the dark forces in the forest. What is their origin and nature? How do they fit into the mythology of this world?
Describe the Frontier villages, the outpost, the farmers living there in more evocative detail to bring the setting to life.

Pacing & Narrative Structure:

The opening feels a bit slow. Consider starting with a more gripping hook that drops the reader right into the action and mystery.
Vary the pacing - intersperse slower, character-driven moments with faster action sequences. Build narrative tension over time.
Ensure each scene has a clear purpose that advances the characters and plot. Avoid exposition that doesn't move the story forward.

Prose & Style:

Some of the sentences are overly long and complex, which hurts readability. Ex: "The outpost was understaffed, the men restless and fearful. Knowing this, Aldric resolved to bolster their ranks." Could be simplified.
Occasionally the word choice feels a bit cliched or melodramatic. Ex: "bleeding towards the horizon", "skeletal sentinel", "malevolent forces". Aim for fresher, more understated language.
That said, there are many examples of vivid, atmospheric prose that sets the dark, ominous tone effectively. The text excels at evoking a moody, foreboding atmosphere.

Themes & Motifs:

Classic fantasy themes of good vs evil, light vs darkness, man vs supernatural are present. Consider ways to explore these in a less black-and-white way for added depth.
The encroaching danger of the shadowy forest is an effective central motif. Continue building on this throughout the story.
Varian's pragmatism vs Elric's respect for nature sets up an interesting thematic contrast to develop further.

Positives:

Strong sense of foreboding atmosphere and mounting danger
Intriguing set-up with the disappearances and dark forces in the forest
Well-sketched fantasy setting with outposts, forests, frontier villages
Solid central cast of characters with Varian, Elric, Aldric

Areas for Improvement:

Pacing in first half is a little slow, lacks a driving hook
Characters need more depth, nuance and development
Some cliched language and overly complex sentences
World-building could be expanded to make the realm richer

In summary, while this excerpt establishes an engaging fantasy premise, it could be elevated further by focusing on creating more compelling, nuanced characters, building out the world in richer detail, tightening up the pacing and prose, and exploring its classic fantasy themes in a fresh way. With some refinement, it could become an even more gripping read for fantasy fans. The strong atmosphere and intriguing set-up provide a solid foundation to build from.
