The sun dipped beneath the horizon as Varian and Elric trudged through the dirt path toward the outpost. Fatigue clung to their bodies like a second skin, mirrored in the furrowed brows that creased their foreheads. Their footsteps echoed off the silent trees, and whispers of unease rattled between them.

"Do you think it's wise to venture this close to goblin territory?" Elric asked, his voice laced with worry. Varian shook his head slowly, the chain of his shield swaying gently against his side as he walked. "Something's not right, I can feel it." 

The pair caught sight of two riders on horseback, galloping from the outpost, their faces grim and sweat-streaked. They pulled up beside Varian and Elric, panting. "Goblins," one rasped between gasps for air. "They killed three cows in frontier villages."

Varian's eyes widened as he looked at the riders. "And they took no meat?" he asked, trying to understand the strange behavior. The rider shook his head. "Just blood and chaos," he replied, before urging his horse forward.

The outpost was abuzz with activity when Varian and Elric arrived. Captain Aldric, a tall man with a shaved head, greeted them with a stern expression. He listened intently as Varian reported the incident of the girl from the village who had been attacked, but no signs of an assailant.

Aldric rubbed his chin thoughtfully, his voice low and grave. "These are not the actions of wild beasts," he muttered, looking out to the treacherous forest that loomed in the distance. "Goblins may be up to something, a ritual perhaps." His men nodded in agreement, their eyes darting between each other and the trees.

"The problem is, we are short-handed here," Elric interjected anxiously, his gaze scanning the outpost's defenses. Varian clenched his fists, concern etching lines on his brow.

Aldric pondered for a moment before he made a decision. "I will recruit some men from the village to help. We must remain vigilant but avoid entering goblin territory." He emphasized the warning, knowing all too well the dangers that lay in those dark woods.

The pair set about checking the outpost's defenses and gathered a dozen men to join the patrols. Varian assigned the new recruits four-hour shifts with experienced guards, hoping their presence would both bolster defense and calm village fears.

As they settled into their watches, an uneasy calm fell over the outpost, broken only by the occasional clink of metal on metal or hushed whispers.

Under the moon's silver glow, Varian and Elric discussed goblin rituals. "I believe evil lives in those woods," Varian confided, shuddering as he gazed into the dark forest.

Their watch was interrupted when they spotted movement among the trees. Their hearts leapt into their throats, only to deflate with disappointment as a scared rabbit scampered away. The incident left Varian unnerved and anxious for dawn.

Back at the outpost, both friends struggled to sleep, haunted by memories of past battles and a palpable sense of impending danger.

As morning broke, a patrol reported finding goblin tracks along the border. It was clear that an attack was imminent, and Varian and Elric prepared their men for battle.

Elric barked orders to sharpen weapons and remain vigilant while Varian pondered the bravery or foolishness of those who live in proximity to such evil.

An atmosphere of nervous energy pervaded the outpost as the men readied themselves for battle, uneasy about what lurked beyond the trees but determined to defend their home from whatever darkness emerged.
