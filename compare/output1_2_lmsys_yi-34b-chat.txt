Varian and Elric trudged through the forest, their boots kicking up dust that danced in the sunlight filtering through the trees. The outpost was silent, the usually bustling trade route now eerily quiet. They had heard the rumors—goblins had been spotted nearby, their green skin and sharp claws a chilling sight to behold. But Varian and Elric were no strangers to danger; they'd faced off against the little creatures before.

"This is madness," Varian muttered, his voice thick with exhaustion. "We're walking into the lion's den."

Elric nodded solemnly. "Aye, but it's our duty to protect the people. We can't let those cowards take what's ours."

As they approached the outpost, a rider burst from the trees, his horse lathered and breathing hard. He reined in his steed, eyes wide with fear.

"Goblins!" he gasped. "They've killed three cows—just tore them apart, but didn't take the meat."

Varian's heart pounded. This was no random attack; the goblins were up to something. He reported the incident to Captain Aldric, a grizzled veteran with a scar that slashed across his cheek.

"This is serious," Aldric growled, his eyes narrowing. "We need to increase patrols and keep a close watch on the borders."

Varian nodded, his worry clear. "But we're short-handed, Captain. We can't hold off an army."

Aldric clapped him on the shoulder. "Then we'll recruit from the village. Anyone willing to stand against these vermin can have a place here."

Varian and Elric set out to gather volunteers, their hearts heavy with the weight of their task. The villagers listened to their plea, eyes wide with a mix of fear and bravery. A dozen men stepped forward, their resolve strong.

"We'll stand with you," a burly farmer named Thomas declared, his voice thick with determination.

Varian assigned the new recruits to four-hour shifts, pairing them with experienced guards. The outpost buzzed with activity as weapons were sharpened and defenses checked. An uneasy calm settled over the camp, each man aware that their lives hung in the balance.

That night, Varian and Elric took their watch, their eyes scanning the treeline for any sign of movement. The forest whispered secrets, and they listened, their hearts beating a steady rhythm.

"Remember the stories," Elric said, his voice barely above a whisper. "Goblins sacrifice to their dark gods."

Varian nodded, his grip on his sword tightening. "Evil lives in those woods," he replied, his voice carrying a hint of fear.

They saw a flicker in the trees, and their hearts raced. But it was only a rabbit, startled by their presence. The tension eased, but Varian couldn't shake the feeling that something was watching them, waiting.

Back at the outpost, sleep eluded them. Memories of past battles and the foreboding presence of the forest haunted their thoughts. They lay awake, their eyes closed, but their minds racing.

In the morning, a patrol returned with news—goblin tracks had been found along the border. The threat was real, and it was imminent.

Varian and Elric knew what this meant—a confrontation was unavoidable. They prepared the men, drilling them in the art of defense. Elric ordered the blacksmith to work non-stop, ensuring every weapon was sharp and every shield sturdy.

Varian couldn't help but reflect on the bravery of the farmers, who had left their fields and families to face the unknown. Were they brave or fools? The question haunted him as he watched them train.

He feared the answer.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows over the outpost, the men readied themselves for the battle to come. Their breaths came in ragged gasps, their hearts thundering in their chests.

Elric stepped forward, his voice firm and unwavering. "We will stand against whatever comes from those trees," he declared. "For the outpost, for our people, and for the light that drives back the darkness."

The men nodded, their eyes shining with a mix of fear and resolve. The night stretched before them, long and silent, but they were ready.

For in the game of the goblins, they were the players now, and they would not shy
