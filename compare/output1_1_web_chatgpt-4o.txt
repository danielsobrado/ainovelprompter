Varian and Elric walked the muddy path toward the outpost. They had been traveling for hours, their bodies weighed down by fatigue and their minds clouded with worry. The recent events haunted them. They had seen signs—ominous and confusing signs—of a threat lurking nearby.

As they approached, riders emerged from the fog. The news they carried made Varian's heart sink. Goblins had killed three cows in the frontier villages. The bodies were left untouched. Varian exchanged a look with Elric, both understanding the gravity of such an act. Goblins did not waste food.

Inside the outpost, they found Captain Aldric poring over maps. Varian reported the attack in the village, describing how a girl had been attacked, yet no assailant was seen. Aldric's face tightened with concern. He ordered increased patrols and a search of the borders.

"This is serious," Aldric said, his voice low. "We need to be vigilant."

"We're short-handed," Varian pointed out. "We need more men."

Aldric nodded. "Recruit from the village. We cannot afford to leave any stone unturned. But heed this warning: do not enter goblin territory. Watch and guard, nothing more."

Varian and Elric spent the next hours checking the outpost’s defenses. The walls seemed sturdy enough, but an uneasy feeling gnawed at Varian. They gathered a dozen men from the village, assigning them to four-hour shifts with experienced guards. The unease in the air was palpable as patrols began. An uneasy calm settled over the outpost.

As night fell, Varian and Elric found themselves discussing the stories they had heard about goblin rituals.

"Do you believe it?" Varian asked, keeping his voice low.

Elric shrugged. "Evil lives in the forest. I believe that much."

During their watch, a movement in the trees caught Varian's eye. His heart pounded as he raised his weapon. A rabbit darted out, frightened but harmless. Varian tried to shake off the unsettling feeling. The dark, foreboding nature of the forest clung to him.

Sleep eluded both men. Memories of the day’s events and the sense of impending danger haunted them. The next morning, a patrol reported finding goblin tracks along the border. The signs indicated a scouting party.

"They're preparing to attack," Elric said, a grim look on his face.

"We need to be ready," Varian replied. "Sharpen your weapons and stay vigilant."

Varian reflected on the bravery—or foolishness—of the farmers who lived near the evil forest. A great evil was stirring in goblin territory, he feared. But Elric’s words provided some comfort.

"We'll stand against whatever comes out of those trees," Elric assured him.

An atmosphere of nervous energy and anticipation filled the outpost. The men sharpened their weapons, eyes darting to the forest with every sound. The impending goblin attack loomed over them like a dark cloud, and they knew the coming days would test their resolve.

Varian and Elric stood side by side, ready to face the threat that lurked in the shadows. The tension in the air was thick, but they were determined. Whatever emerged from the trees, they would meet it head-on.
