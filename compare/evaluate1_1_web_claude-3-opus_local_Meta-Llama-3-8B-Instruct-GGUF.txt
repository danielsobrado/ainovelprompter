Here are some areas where this fantasy text could be enhanced to align with the standards of commercial fantasy novels:
Character Development:

Provide more insight into Varian and Elric's backgrounds, motivations, and inner conflicts. Show how their past experiences shape their current attitudes and actions.
Develop the secondary characters like Captain Aldric more. Give them distinct personalities and roles in the story.
Include more dialogue and interaction between characters to reveal their relationships and contrasting viewpoints.

World-Building:

Add more vivid descriptions of the setting, including sensory details about the outpost, forest, and surrounding lands. Make the world feel alive and immersive.
Provide some history and context about the conflict with the goblins. What led to the current situation? Are there cultural, political or magical factors at play?
Introduce elements of the larger fantasy world, such as mentioning other realms, races, or power structures. This will make the world feel more expansive.

Pacing and Narrative Structure:

The pacing feels a bit rushed. Consider expanding certain scenes, like the discussions between Varian and Elric, to build tension and suspense.
Use foreshadowing and hints to build up to the impending goblin attack. Sprinkle in clues and omens throughout.
Vary the structure with a balance of action, dialogue, introspection and description. Extended sections of summary can slow the pace.

Prose and Style:

Some of the sentences are a bit bland and lack punch. Vary sentence length and structure. Use strong verbs and avoid overusing "was/were".
Provide more sensory details and visceral reactions to immerse the reader in the characters' experiences. Show the dread and foreboding they feel.
Careful use of figurative language and imagery could enhance the ominous tone when describing the evil forest and goblins.

Themes and Motifs:

Classic fantasy motifs of good vs evil and civilization vs wilderness are present. Consider ways to put a fresh spin on these.
Explore themes of bravery, duty, and the psychological toll of facing an ever-present threat. Go deeper into the characters' psyches.
The goblins are portrayed as unambiguously evil. Adding some moral complexity or nuance to their depiction could be interesting.

Some positives:

The fantasy concept of an outpost on the edge of a dangerous, monster-filled forest is compelling
The camaraderie between Varian and Elric comes through in their interactions
There's a clear sense of rising action and impending danger that propels the story forward

Some negatives:

The characters feel somewhat generic and underdeveloped at this stage
The world-building is minimal, lacking texture and scope
The prose is serviceable but lacks refinement and vividness in places

With some polishing and expansion in the areas noted above, this tale could be shaped into an engrossing dark fantasy story in a fleshed-out secondary world. The bones of the story are solid, but adding muscle and skin to the skeletal structure with richer characterization, world-building, prose, and thematic exploration would elevate it further. Homing in on the core conflict and really making the reader feel the dread and stakes would maximize the story's impact.
