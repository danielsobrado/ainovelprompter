"Locked. Seems like someone doesn't want his secrets exposed. I can work with that."

Varian rubbed his tired eyes as he and Elric walked towards the outpost. The sun was setting, casting a reddish glow over the rustic buildings. They had been riding all day, and the weight of their responsibilities was starting to settle in.

As they approached, riders burst out of the gates, their horses whinnying in excitement. "Wait! Captain Aldric wants to see you," one of them called out, reining in his horse.

Varian and Elric exchanged a concerned glance. What could be so urgent?

Inside the outpost, Captain Aldric's expression was grave. "Three cows have been killed in the frontier villages, but the bodies are missing. It's like the goblins didn't take them."

"Goblins?" Elric repeated, his voice low.

Aldric nodded. "Riders found some tracks, but they're light. It's like they're hiding something."

Varian's gut twisted. This wasn't good. He reported the incident to the villagers, but the girl who'd been attacked remained silent, her eyes wide with fear. No attacker was found, but the villagers were spooked.

Aldric's face was grim. "I'm increasing patrols, and I want you both to help with the search. We need to know what's going on."

Varian and Elric exchanged a worried glance. The outpost was already short-handed, and the last thing they needed was to be spread thin.

"I'll take a few men from the village," Aldric said, anticipating their concerns. "We'll make do with what we have."

As they left the outpost, Varian's unease grew. They were walking into the unknown, and he didn't like it one bit.

The darkness seemed to press in around them as they checked the outpost's defenses. Elric assigned the new recruits to four-hour shifts with experienced guards. An uneasy calm settled over the outpost as patrols began.

Varian and Elric took their watch, eyes scanning the forest. They discussed the stories about goblin rituals, Varian convinced that evil lived in those trees.

"I don't like it," he said, his voice low. "This feels wrong."

Elric placed a hand on his shoulder. "We'll be ready. We have to be."

As they stood there, a movement caught Varian's eye. A rabbit darted out of the trees, its eyes wide with fear. Varian's instincts screamed at him to grab his sword, but it was just a rabbit.

Or was it?

The two friends struggled to sleep, haunted by memories and the sense of impending danger.

The next morning, a patrol reported finding goblin tracks along the border. Elric's face turned grim. "They're scouting. We need to be ready."

Varian's gut twisted. This was it. The goblins were coming, and they had to be ready.

As the day wore on, the tension mounted. The men sharpened their weapons, their eyes fixed on the forest. Varian's thoughts turned to the farmers who lived near the evil forest. Brave or foolish, they were about to face a great evil.

Elric's voice cut through the silence. "We'll stand against whatever threat emerges from those trees."

Varian's eyes met Elric's, and for a moment, they just stared into the darkness. The outpost was on edge, waiting for the goblins to make their move.
