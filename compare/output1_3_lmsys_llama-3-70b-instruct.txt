Varian and Elric trudged towards the outpost, their worn boots kicking up dust on the dry path. The weight of recent events hung heavy on their shoulders, their faces etched with worry.

As they approached the outpost, riders emerged from the trees, their faces grave. "Goblins," one of them said, his voice tight. "Three cows killed in frontier villages. No bodies taken."

Varian's grip on his sword hilt tightened. "We need to report this to Captain Aldric."

Inside the outpost, Captain Aldric's expression turned grim as Varian relayed the news. "This changes things," he said, his voice firm. "We need to increase patrols and search the borders."

Varian and Elric exchanged a concerned glance. "We're short-handed, Captain," Elric said. "We can't cover the entire border."

Aldric's eyes narrowed. "Recruit men from the village, then. We need all hands on deck."

"But, Captain," Varian began, "what about entering goblin territory?"

Aldric's expression turned stern. "I didn't say to enter goblin territory. I said to watch and guard. We don't know what we're dealing with yet."

Varian and Elric nodded, their faces set with determination. They spent the rest of the day checking the outpost's defenses and gathering a dozen men from the village to help with patrols. Varian assigned the new recruits to four-hour shifts with experienced guards, his mind racing with the possibilities.

As night fell, an uneasy calm settled over the outpost. The patrols began, and Varian and Elric stood watch, their eyes scanning the darkness beyond the torches.

"I've heard stories about goblin rituals," Elric said, his voice low. "Do you think they're true?"

Varian's gaze never left the trees. "I think evil lives in that forest. I can feel it."

Elric nodded, his eyes somber. "Me too."

A rustling in the trees made them both tense, but it was only a scared rabbit, its eyes wide with fear. Varian's unease lingered, his skin crawling at the darkness that seemed to seep from the forest like a living entity.

That night, sleep eluded them, their minds haunted by memories and the sense of impending danger. The next morning, a patrol reported finding goblin tracks along the border, and Varian and Elric exchanged a grim glance.

"They're scouting," Elric said, his voice tight. "Preparing to attack."

Varian's grip on his sword hilt tightened. "We need to be ready."

Elric nodded, his eyes flashing with determination. "Sharpen your weapons, men. We don't know when they'll come."

Varian watched the men scramble to prepare, his mind racing with the bravery or foolishness of the farmers who lived near the evil forest. He feared that a great evil was stirring in goblin territory, one that would stop at nothing to destroy them all.

Elric clapped him on the back. "We'll stand against whatever emerges from those trees, Varian. Together."

Varian nodded, a sense of determination settling in his chest. But the darkness beyond the outpost's walls seemed to whisper a different tale, one of uncertainty and fear.
