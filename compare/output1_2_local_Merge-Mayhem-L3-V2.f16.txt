Chapter 2: Ominous Shadows

Varian trudged alongside Elric, his boots heavy with each step. "We're almost there," he said, squinting at the outpost's distant silhouette. The sun dipped lower on the horizon, casting long shadows across the dusty terrain.

Riders approached them, their worn leather saddles creaking in unison. "Captain Aldric wants to see you two as soon as possible," one of the riders announced, his eyes darting nervously between Varian and Elric.

Inside the outpost, Captain Aldric's stern expression greeted them. "Goblins have killed three cows in the frontier villages. No signs of bodies, just... nothing." His voice was laced with a mix of frustration and concern.

Varian rubbed his tired eyes. "That's not goblin behavior. They usually leave some sign of their work."

Captain Aldric nodded. "I agree. It's like they're trying to send a message or something."

Elric frowned. "What kind of message?"

Aldric shrugged. "I don't know, but I don't like it. We need to increase patrols and search the borders. I want you both to report any unusual activity."

Varian and Elric exchanged worried glances. The outpost was already short-staffed, and adding more men would only make things worse. But they couldn't ignore the captain's orders.

As they left the captain's office, Varian whispered, "We're in trouble, friend. We need to get our priorities straight."

Elric nodded, his jaw set firmly. "I'm with you, Varian. Let's get this done."

The two friends made their way through the outpost, checking defenses and gathering a dozen men from the village to help with patrols. Varian assigned the new recruits to four-hour shifts with experienced guards.

As night began to fall, an uneasy calm settled over the outpost. Patrols set out into the darkness, their torches casting flickering shadows on the ground. Varian and Elric took their watch, scanning the treeline for any sign of movement.

"I don't like this," Varian muttered, his eyes fixed on the trees. "It's too quiet."

Elric grunted in agreement. "Goblins are usually loud when they're around. This feels wrong."

A scared rabbit darted from the underbrush, causing both men to jump. They exchanged uneasy glances.

Varian tried to shake off the feeling of unease, but it lingered. He couldn't help but wonder what evil lurked in those dark woods.

As they made their way back to their quarters, Elric turned to him. "You think we'll find anything tonight?"

Varian shook his head. "I doubt it. But we can't afford to let our guard down."

The night passed slowly, punctuated by the distant howling of wolves and the occasional bark of a dog. Varian and Elric struggled to sleep, their minds racing with thoughts of goblin attacks and the weight of responsibility.

The next morning, a patrol returned with news of finding goblin tracks along the border â€“ clear evidence that a scouting party had been in the area.

Varian's gut twisted into knots. "It's happening," he whispered, his eyes wide with fear. "They're coming."

Elric clapped him on the back. "We'll be ready. We have to be."

As the men of the outpost sharpened their weapons and took up positions, Varian couldn't help but think of the farmers who lived near the evil forest. Brave or foolish, they chose to live in the shadow of that darkness.

He turned to Elric, his voice low. "I fear what's coming from those trees."

Elric met his gaze, unwavering. "We'll stand against it together. We have each other's backs."

The air was thick with nervous energy as the outpost prepared for the impending goblin attack. The men moved with a quiet intensity, their eyes fixed on the forest's ominous shadows.

Varian knew that this was just the beginning of a long and bloody fight. But he also knew that he would not go down without a fight, not as long as Elric stood by his side.

The two friends shared a determined look before returning to their stations, ready to face whatever horrors the forest had in store for them.
