Here are some suggestions for enhancing this fantasy text to align with the standards of commercial fantasy novels:
Character Development:

Provide more details about the backstories, motivations, and internal conflicts of the main characters Varian and Elric. What drives them? What are their fears and aspirations?
Show character growth over the course of the narrative. How do the events impact them emotionally and change their perspectives?
Include more dialogue and interactions between characters to reveal their personalities and relationships.

World-Building:

The evil forest and goblin threat are intriguing, but more vivid descriptions of the setting, history, and lore would help immerse readers in the fantasy world.
Explain the societal structures, politics, and culture of the human settlements. What is daily life like?
Hint at a wider world beyond just this immediate area to create a sense of depth and scope.

Pacing and Narrative Structure:

The pacing feels a bit uneven, with some sections rushing through events while others linger on minute details. Aim for a more balanced mix of action, dialogue, introspection and exposition.
Consider using a traditional story structure (e.g. the Hero's Journey) to give the narrative a clearer arc and sense of momentum. Set up the stakes and conflicts early on.
The frequent jumping between summary telling and immediate showing is a bit jarring. Smooth out the transitions for better flow.

Prose and Style:

The writing is generally solid, with some evocative turns of phrase ("The darkness seemed to close in around us").
However, some of the wording feels a bit clunky or cliched at times ("We'll stand against whatever threat emerges from the trees"). Strive for a more natural, distinctive voice.
Vary sentence structures and lengths for better rhythm. Break up longer expository passages with dialogue or character actions.

Themes and Tone:

Classic fantasy themes of good vs. evil and bravery in the face of danger are present, but could be explored in more depth and nuance.
The ominous, foreboding tone is effective initially but grows a bit one-note. Injecting more varied emotions (moments of levity, beauty, tenderness, etc.) could create richer atmosphere.
Clarity about the themes and ultimate message will give the story more resonance and meaning. What is this really about under the surface?

Positives:

Intriguing premise of an evil looming in a dangerous forest and humans rallying to defend against it
Some vivid details paint the scene, like the unease seeping into the air like a chill
Camaraderie between Varian and Elric comes through in their interactions
Raises compelling questions that make readers want to know what will happen next

Negatives:

Lacks specificity and depth in character development and world-building
Pacing and narrative structure need smoothing out for better flow
Prose is workmanlike but not yet at a professional level
Themes and emotional tones need added complexity and resonance

With revision to add more vibrant details, richer characterizations, smoother pacing, and thematic depth, this story could become an engrossing fantasy page-turner. The core elements of an epic tale of good vs. evil are here - honing the craft elements would allow that potential to shine through. Focusing on evoking emotions, creating relatable characters, and painting a transportive world are key next steps.
