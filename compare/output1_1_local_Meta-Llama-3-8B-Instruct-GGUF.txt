Varian trudged alongside Elric, their boots scuffling against the dry earth as they approached the outpost. Exhaustion weighed heavy on their shoulders, the weight of recent events bearing down on them like a physical force.

"What's the news from the riders?" Varian asked, his voice low and even.

Elric shook his head. "Three cows killed in frontier villages. No signs of struggle or bodies taken."

Varian's grip on his sword hilt tightened. "Goblins."

Their arrival at the outpost was met with Captain Aldric's stern expression. "Ah, Varian and Elric. I've been expecting you. Riders just arrived with news of the goblin attacks."

Varian reported their findings to the captain, recounting the details of the incident in the village where a young girl had been attacked but no attacker found.

Captain Aldric's face darkened. "We must increase patrols and search our borders. I'll also recall some men from the village to bolster our numbers."

Varian and Elric exchanged a concerned glance. The outpost was already understaffed, and adding more men would only stretch their resources thinner.

"We should be cautious," Captain Aldric warned. "Don't enter goblin territory unless absolutely necessary. Your task is to watch and guard, not engage with the enemy."

As they checked the outpost's defenses, Varian assigned a dozen new recruits from the village to four-hour shifts with experienced guards. An uneasy calm settled over the outpost as patrols began.

Over dinner, Varian and Elric discussed the stories about goblin rituals, Varian's conviction growing that evil lurked in the forest. Elric countered with tales of dark magic, but both men remained unsettled by the forest's foreboding nature.

Their watch was uneventful until they spotted a movement in the trees â€“ a scared rabbit darting for cover. Varian's unease lingered, his mind consumed by the darkness and danger that lurked beyond the outpost's walls.

As night wore on, neither man slept well, haunted by memories and the sense of impending doom. The next morning, a patrol reported finding goblin tracks along the border, signaling a scouting party's presence.

Varian and Elric exchanged a grim look. "The goblins are preparing to attack," Varian said, his voice low and deadly serious.

Elric ordered the men to sharpen their weapons and remain vigilant. Varian reflected on the bravery or foolishness of the farmers who lived near the evil forest, fearing that a great evil was stirring in goblin territory.

As Elric reassured him they would stand against whatever threat emerged from the trees, an atmosphere of nervous energy and anticipation permeated the outpost. The men prepared for battle, their eyes fixed on the darkness beyond the walls, waiting for the inevitable attack to come.

The air was heavy with tension as Varian and Elric stood watch, their minds racing with the unknown dangers that lurked in the shadows. The forest seemed to be watching them, its malevolent presence growing stronger by the hour.
