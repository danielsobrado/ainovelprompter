Here are some ways the provided fantasy text could be enhanced to align with the standards of commercial fantasy novels:
Character Development:

Provide more insight into Varian and Elric's backstories, motivations, and unique personalities to make them feel more three-dimensional.
Show how this dangerous situation affects them emotionally and impacts their relationship.
Introduce more distinctive traits, flaws, and arcs for secondary characters like Captain Aldric and the new village recruits.

World-Building:

Include more vivid descriptions of the outpost, surrounding villages, and menacing forest to immerse the reader in the fantasy setting.
Hint at the larger geopolitical context, history, and lore of this world, such as the origins of the goblin threat and darkness in the forest.
Selectively incorporate more sensory details - sights, sounds, smells, textures - to make scenes come alive.

Pacing and Narrative Structure:

The pacing is a bit uneven, with a slower build-up and abrupt ending. Restructure to heighten tension and anticipation more steadily.
Consider opening with a gripping scene to hook readers, then weave in background details.
Flesh out the climax and resolution more. End with a stronger sense of change or realization for the characters.

Prose and Readability:

Overall the prose is clear and readable. Vivid lines like "the setting sun casting long shadows" and "the whispers of the woods" enhance the ominous tone.
Some of the dialogue tags ("he said slowly", "he declared") could be replaced with action beats or cut completely.
Vary sentence structure and length more to improve flow. Occasional run-on sentences make it harder to follow.

Themes and Tone:

Classic fantasy motifs of good vs. evil, fear of the unknown, and courage in the face of darkness are handled well.
The tone captures the characters' unease, dread and grim resolve effectively.
To go deeper, explore themes of how people respond to looming threats, what darkness lies in human nature itself, etc.

Positives:

Creates an anxious, foreboding atmosphere that fits the fantasy genre
Clearly portrays the immediate goblin threat and characters' reactions to it
Prose is overall solid and appropriate for the intended audience

Negatives:

Lacks in-depth characterization to really make us care about Varian, Elric and others
World-building details are sparse, missing an opportunity to create a vivid fantasy setting
Pacing and story structure could be tweaked to maximize engagement and impact

In summary, while this text has potential, it needs further development of the characters, world, themes, and story arc to fully engage readers on both an emotional and intellectual level, as the best commercial fantasy novels do. With more polish, it could become a more immersive and impactful fantasy story.
