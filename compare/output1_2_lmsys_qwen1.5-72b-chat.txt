Varian and Elric trudged wearily toward the outpost, their footsteps heavy with the weight of recent events. They exchanged worried glances, their minds preoccupied with the news they'd heard from passing riders. Goblins, it seemed, had struck three frontier villages, slaughtering cows without taking the flesh. An eerie silence hung in the air, broken only by the distant hoot of an owl.

Varian shared the tale of a village girl, attacked in the night, but with no sign of her assailant. Captain Aldric, a seasoned veteran, listened intently, his brow furrowed. The gravity of the situation settled upon him, and he ordered immediate action: doubled patrols, a thorough search along the borders.

"We can't afford to be understaffed," Varian rasped, his voice hoarse from days on the trail. Elric nodded in agreement, his broad shoulders slumped.

Aldric, recognizing their concern, decided to recruit men from the village. "But warn them," he cautioned, "not to provoke the goblins, only to watch and guard."

The pair inspected the outpost's defenses, its walls weathered but sturdy. Varian rallied a dozen villagers, assigning them to four-hour shifts alongside seasoned guards. The new recruits, a mix of eager and hesitant, took their posts under his watchful eye.

An uneasy calm settled over the stronghold as the patrols began, the only sounds the clink of metal and the hushed whispers of the night breeze. Varian and Elric, their watchful gaze fixed on the dark forest, discussed the whispers of goblin rituals. Varian, ever the believer in the evil that lurked, felt a chill run down his spine.

During their watch, a rustling in the underbrush caught their attention. A frightened rabbit darted across the moonlit clearing, but Varian's heart pounded, his mind haunted by the shadows.

Sleep evaded both men that night, their dreams plagued by half-glimpsed shapes and the distant howl of unseen beasts. As dawn broke, a patrol returned with grim news: goblin tracks were found near the border, suggesting a scouting party.

Varian's eyes narrowed, his resolve steeling. "We must be ready," he said to Elric, who tersely instructed the men to hone their weapons and stay alert.

Varian found himself musing on the farmers who dared to call the forest's edge their home. Were they brave or foolhardy? He sensed an ancient, malevolent force stirring within the goblin territory.

Elric, sensing his friend's unease, placed a comforting hand on his shoulder. "We'll face whatever comes," he vowed, his voice firm.

The outpost hummed with nervous energy, each man's preparations tinged with anticipation. The threat of a goblin assault loomed large, casting a pall over the morning air. As the sun climbed higher, the men stood ready, their eyes fixed on the dark heart of the forest, waiting for the inevitable clash.
