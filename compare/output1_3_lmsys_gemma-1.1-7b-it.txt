The biting wind carried whispers through the skeletal branches of the Whispering Wood. Varian and Elric trudged along the shadowed path, faces pale beneath hooded cloaks. Three days ago, whispers of carnage had reached the outpost â€“ cows mangled, their carcasses untouched. Tonight, their own village lay under the shadow of fear.

"Three whole cows, vanished without a trace," Varian muttered, eyes heavy.

Elric placed a hand on his shoulder. "It's like something out of an old tale."

At the outpost, Captain Aldric awaited them, face grim. "You bring news of escalating goblin activity."

Varian recounted the attack on the young girl, the only survivor fleeing with only scraps of memory. Aldric sighed, eyes dark. "Time to take precautions. Increase patrols, extend the border watch."

"But we're already stretched thin," Varian protested, his voice tight. "We can't afford to lose men."

Aldric placed a hand on his shoulder. "Then we recruit from the village. Tell them their families need them, their land needs them."

He then issued a stark warning. "Do not enter goblin territory. Observe, defend, but do not attack. Their wrath is swift."

A tense calm settled over the outpost. Men with weathered faces and eyes reflecting the approaching twilight volunteered, their voices hushed whispers in the night. Varian assigned them four-hour shifts, partnering experienced soldiers with the new recruits.

As the night deepened, whispers seemed to grow louder. Varian shared chilling stories of goblin rituals, of grotesque offerings and warped desires. Elric placed a hand on his arm, a silent plea for reassurance.

Their watch passed in agonizing slowness. Then, a movement in the trees. A flash of grey, a fleeting shadow. Elric grabbed Varian's arm. "Rabbit."

Yet, the forest seemed to drain the peace from them. The darkness held a knowing silence, a melody of rustling leaves and the whispers growing louder, more menacing. Sleep was a distant dream.

The next morning, a patrol returned with disturbing news. Tracks of goblin scouts circled the border. The whispers had become a chorus.

Elric bellowed, "Sharpen your weapons! Stay vigilant!"

Varian watched the men, faces lit by the flickering flames. Some flinched, others stared ahead with grim determination. He wondered if the villagers, living on the edge of a monstrous forest, were brave or foolish.

"We stand against whatever darkness stirs within those trees," Elric declared, his voice firm.

The outpost shifted, a collective breath held before the inevitable clash. The whispers grew louder, a prelude to the storm.
