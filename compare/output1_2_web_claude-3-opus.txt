Varian's boots crunched on the gravel path, each step heavier than the last. Beside him, Elric's jaw clenched, his hand never straying far from his sword hilt. The outpost loomed ahead, a fortress of stone and timber standing resolute against the encroaching forest.
"Riders came in last night," Captain Aldric said as they reached the gates. Dark circles underscored his eyes. "Goblins killed three cows out in the frontier villages."
Varian frowned. "They didn't take the bodies?"
Aldric shook his head. "Left 'em to rot where they fell."
"The girl." Elric's voice was strained. "In the village. Something attacked her?"
"Aye. But we found no trace of her attacker."
Aldric rubbed his stubbled chin. "This is no mere livestock raid. I've ordered extra patrols and a thorough search of our borders."
"We're already stretched thin," Varian said, eyeing the battlements. "We need more men."
"I'll conscript from the village. But Varian, Elric..." Aldric's gaze hardened. "Do not cross into their territory. Watch and guard only. Are we clear?"
"Yes sir." The words tasted bitter on Varian's tongue.
They spent the morning reinforcing the outpost's defenses, shoring up weak points in the palisade and distributing extra arrows to the watch towers. By midday, a dozen men from the village had assembled, clutching rusted swords and makeshift spears.
Varian divided them into shifts, pairing each newcomer with a seasoned guard. "Four hours on, eight off. Stay alert. If you see anything, sound the alarm immediately."
As dusk fell, an uneasy calm settled over the outpost. Torches flickered along the walls, casting distorted shadows across the courtyard. Varian paced the ramparts, Elric at his side.
"You ever hear the stories?" Elric asked, his voice hushed. "About the rituals they perform out there in the dark?"
Varian nodded grimly. "Blood sacrifices. Pacts with fell beasts. Some say the very trees are alive with malice."
"You think it's true? That evil dwells in those woods?"
A twig snapped in the underbrush. Varian's hand flew to his sword, breath catching in his throat. A heartbeat passed. Two.
A rabbit bolted from the brush, darting into the night.
Varian exhaled slowly. "I think there are things in this world we were never meant to understand."
They finished their watch in silence, each lost in his own thoughts. When their relief arrived, they trudged to their tent, exhaustion tugging at their limbs.
But sleep proved elusive. Varian stared at the canvas ceiling, images of the dark forest and the unknown threats lurking within its depths playing across his mind. Beside him, Elric tossed and turned, muttering incoherently.
Dawn had barely broken when a shout rang out across the compound. Varian burst from the tent, Elric close on his heels.
A patrol had just returned, their faces grim. "Goblin tracks, sir. Along the border. Looks like a scouting party."
Elric cursed under his breath. "They're testing our defenses. Preparing for an attack."
Varian nodded, his mind racing. "Rouse the men. I want everyone on high alert. Double the watch and send riders to warn the frontier villages."
"And the border?"
Varian's jaw tightened. "Fortify it. But do not cross it. Not yet."
As Elric stalked off to relay the orders, Varian turned his gaze to the forest. The trees seemed to lean in, their branches grasping, hungry. A shiver crawled up his spine despite the morning sun's warmth.
These farmers were either brave or foolish, living in the shadow of such darkness. How could they sleep at night, knowing what lurked just beyond the treeline?
Yet here they remained, stubborn and defiant in the face of an ancient evil. An evil that even now was stirring, gathering its strength for the onslaught to come.
Varian's hand strayed to the silver hilt at his side. Let them come, the snarling beasts with their blood-soaked altars and twisted rites. He would face them. He would-
"Varian." Elric's voice, nudging him back to the present.
His friend stood beside him, eyes fixed on the trees. "We'll stop them. Whatever crawls out of that accursed wood, we'll send it right back to the pit that spawned it."
Varian clasped his shoulder, drawing strength from the contact. "Aye. That we will."
But as the sun climbed and the day wore on, the sense of foreboding only grew. Soldiers clustered in small groups, speaking in hushed tones and casting furtive glances at the forest. Even the horses seemed skittish, tossing their heads and stamping at shadows.
By nightfall, the tension was a living thing, coiled and ready to strike. Men patrolled the walls in tense silence, hands white-knuckled on their weapons. In the courtyard, others hunched over whetstones, the rasp of steel on stone a discordant counterpoint to the chirping crickets.
Varian stood atop the western watchtower, Elric a silent presence at his side. The moon hung swollen and yellow above the treetops, casting an eerie glow over the landscape.
A flicker of movement caught his eye. There, in the underbrush. A glint of metal. The rustle of something far larger than a rabbit.
His breath caught in his throat.
Elric's hand clamped down on his arm. "You see it?"
Varian nodded grimly, drawing his sword. The blade sang as it cleared the scabbard, a piercing note in the preternatural stillness.
"Sound the alarm. They're coming."
The bell tolled, its urgent peals shattering the night, as the first inhuman screech rose from the darkness of the trees.
And the battle for the borderlands began.
