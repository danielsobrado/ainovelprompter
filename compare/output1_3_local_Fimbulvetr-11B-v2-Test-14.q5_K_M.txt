The sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows across the dirt path that Varian and Elric traversed. Their boots crunched gravel as they approached the outpost, both men's faces lined with fatigue and worry. In the fading light, the distant hum of arrows being notched and axes being sharpened reached their ears.

"How long have you been traveling?" Elric asked, concern lacing his voice. Varian glanced at him, a shadow passing over his features.

"Long enough," he answered, wiping a hand across his brow. "The villages are on edge."

Just beyond the outpost gates, two horse riders dismounted, exchanging hurried words with a soldier. Varian and Elric listened intently as the news filtered back to them—goblins had killed three cows in frontier villages without taking their prey. 

"No bodies?" Elric muttered. "They're acting strange."

Varian nodded, remembering the girl from the village they'd just left. Mauled by something unseen, her screams still echoing in his mind. He reported the incident to Captain Aldric as they entered the outpost. The seasoned soldier listened, his expression darkening with each detail. 

"I warned them," he said when Varian finished. "The goblins have grown bold." His voice carried an edge of frustration, but there was no denying the gravity in his tone. He turned to a group of men nearby. "Increased patrols. Search every inch of our borders. I want no stone left unturned."

Varian and Elric exchanged a look, both thinking the same thing—the outpost already seemed short-handed. Aldric must have read their thoughts, because he spoke next. "We'll take men from the village, supplement our ranks. But make it clear they aren't to enter goblin territory."

Varian and Elric shared a sigh of relief but knew the task ahead wouldn't be easy. The outpost was already tense, the air thick with anticipation. They set about checking defenses—arrow slits clean, walls sturdy, oil at the ready for the braziers in case of an attack.

As night fell, Varian gathered a dozen men from the village to help with patrols. He assigned them four-hour shifts alongside experienced guards. The new recruits shifted nervously under his gaze, a mix of fear and bravado evident on their faces as they received their marching orders.

An uneasy calm settled over the outpost as the men took up their positions. Varian and Elric sat beside one another, their eyes never straying far from the dark forest that loomed in the distance. They spoke of goblin rituals, of tales told by travelers who'd braved the evil wood.

"Do you believe it, Varian?" Elric asked, his voice low. "That there's real evil out there?"

Varian gazed into the shadows, swallowing hard as he considered the question. "I've seen enough to know darkness thrives in those trees. And I fear whatever we face will be far more terrible than a simple goblin raid."

Throughout their watch, neither man stirred from their post. A rustling in the leaves drew their attention, only to reveal a scared rabbit darting for safety. It did little to ease Varian's unease, though; he remained unsettled by the forest's oppressive nature, as if it were a living entity waiting to devour them all.

Sleep proved elusive that night, both friends haunted by memories and the palpable sense of impending danger. Their minds raced with visions of goblin spears piercing flesh, screams echoing through the dark.

Morning dawned, bringing a new set of challenges. A patrol returned, grim-faced, to report finding goblin tracks along the border—signs that scouts had been probing their defenses. Aldric listened intently before speaking. "A scouting party. The signs point to an attack."

Varian and Elric shared a glance, nodding in grim agreement. They gathered the men, urging them to sharpen weapons and remain vigilant. Varian couldn't help but wonder at the bravery—or foolishness—of farmers who chose to live near such evil. A sense of dread gnawed at his gut as he pondered whether a great evil truly stirred in goblin territory.

Elric placed a hand on his shoulder, offering support and strength. "Whatever comes," he said, his voice firm, "we stand together. We'll face this threat head-on."

As the day progressed, an atmosphere of nervous energy and anticipation pervaded the outpost. Men sharpened swords, checked bowstrings, and huddled in quiet conversations laced with fear and determination. The air crackled with tension, a storm brewing as they waited for the goblins to make their move.
