Varian and Elric trudged towards the outpost, their steps heavy with fatigue and worry. The recent string of events had left a shadow over their usual camaraderie.

"Three cows, Elric," Varian said, his voice barely above a whisper. "Goblins, I reckon. No bodies, though."

Elric nodded, his brow furrowed. "And the girl in the village, no attacker in sight."

Captain Aldric, overhearing their conversation, approached them. His usually stern face was etched with concern. "We can't ignore these signs," he said, his voice grave. "I'm ordering increased patrols and a thorough search of our borders."

Varian and Elric exchanged worried glances. "The outpost is already short-handed, Captain," Varian said. "How can we manage?"

Aldric met Varian's gaze. "We'll recruit men from the village. They'll help with the patrols."

"But they mustn't venture into goblin territory," Aldric warned. "Just watch and guard."

Varian and Elric nodded, their faces grim. They checked the outpost's defenses, their minds racing with the implications of the Captain's orders.

Varian gathered a dozen men from the village, assigning them to four-hour shifts with the experienced guards. The outpost buzzed with activity as the men prepared for their duties.

As the uneasy calm settled over the outpost, Varian and Elric found themselves lost in thought. They discussed tales of goblin rituals, Varian's belief that evil lurked within the forest echoing in their conversation.

During their watch, they spotted a movement in the trees. It was just a rabbit, scared and darting away. But the sight did little to ease Varian's unease. The forest, with its dark and foreboding nature, continued to unsettle him.

The night was long, and sleep eluded them. Memories haunted their thoughts, and a sense of impending danger hung heavy in the air.

The next morning, a patrol reported goblin tracks along the border. The scouting party was closer than they had hoped. The threat was real, and they were ready to defend.

Varian and Elric exchanged a look of determination. They would stand against whatever threat emerged from the forest.

The outpost was alive with nervous energy. The men sharpened their weapons, their faces set in grim determination. The air was thick with anticipation, the sense of impending danger palpable.

Varian looked out at the forest, his heart heavy. He feared what might stir in the darkness, the great evil that might emerge from the trees.

But Elric stood beside him, his gaze steady. "We will stand," he said. "Against whatever comes."

And so, they stood, ready to face the darkness, their resolve unbroken. The forest loomed ominously, but they were prepared. The battle was yet to come, but they were ready.
