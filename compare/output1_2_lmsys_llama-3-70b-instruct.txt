Varian and Elric trudged through the dusty road, their tired eyes fixed on the outpost in the distance. The worn leather of their boots creaked with each step, echoing the fatigue that weighed them down. The silence between them was heavy with concern, the recent events in the frontier villages weighing on their minds.

As they approached the outpost, a group of riders emerged from the gate, their faces grim. "Goblins," one of them spat, "killed three cows in the villages. Didn't even take the bodies."

Varian's grip on his sword tightened. "We need to report this to Captain Aldric."

Inside the outpost, Captain Aldric listened intently as Varian recounted the incident in the village where a girl was attacked. The captain's expression grew increasingly grave, his eyes narrowing as he scribbled notes on a parchment.

"This is getting serious," he muttered, his voice low and urgent. "I want increased patrols and a search of the borders. We can't let them catch us off guard."

Varian and Elric exchanged a worried glance. "We're short-handed, Captain," Varian pointed out.

Aldric's gaze snapped up. "Recruit men from the village, then. We need all the help we can get."

"But, Captain," Elric cautioned, "we can't let them enter goblin territory. We need to watch and guard, not provoke them."

Aldric's face set in a firm line. "I know, I know. Just make sure they understand the risks."

Varian and Elric spent the rest of the day checking the outpost's defenses and gathering a dozen men from the village to help with patrols. Varian assigned the new recruits to four-hour shifts with experienced guards, his mind racing with the possibilities.

As night fell, an uneasy calm settled over the outpost. The patrols began, and Varian and Elric took their turn, their eyes scanning the darkness.

"You think it's true, don't you?" Elric asked, his voice low. "About the goblin rituals?"

Varian's gaze didn't waver from the trees. "I think evil lives in that forest, Elric. And we're sitting right on its doorstep."

Their conversation was interrupted by a faint movement in the trees. Varian's hand instinctively went to his sword, but it was just a scared rabbit, darting across their path.

Varian's unease lingered, the darkness of the forest pressing in on him like a physical force. He couldn't shake the feeling that they were being watched, that unblinking eyes were trained on them from the shadows.

The night wore on, the silence between them punctuated only by the occasional hoot of an owl or the distant howl of a wolf. Varian and Elric struggled to sleep, haunted by memories and the sense of impending danger.

The next morning, a patrol reported finding goblin tracks along the border. Varian and Elric exchanged a grim glance. The goblins were scouting, preparing to attack.

"We need to be ready," Elric said, his voice firm.

Varian nodded, his mind racing with strategies. "Get the men to sharpen their weapons. We need to be vigilant."

As the day wore on, the atmosphere at the outpost grew more tense. The men moved with a sense of purpose, their eyes darting towards the forest as if expecting an attack at any moment.

Varian couldn't help but think of the farmers who lived near the forest, their bravery or foolishness a constant reminder of the dangers that lurked in the shadows. He feared that a great evil was stirring in goblin territory, one that would not stop until it had claimed the outpost and everyone in it.

Elric's hand on his shoulder was a reassuring presence. "We'll stand against whatever comes out of those trees, Varian. Together."

Varian's gaze met Elric's, a spark of determination igniting within him. They would defend their home, no matter the cost.
