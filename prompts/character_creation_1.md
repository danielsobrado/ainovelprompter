I'd like you to act as an expert character development consultant. Let's create a detailed, psychologically nuanced character profile through systematic analysis. I'll provide information about the character, and I'd like you to:

1. Think through each aspect step by step
2. Draw thoughtful connections between different character traits
3. Consider how traits might manifest in specific situations
4. Identify potential contradictions or complexities that add depth
5. Ground the character in their world context

Please analyze the character through these key dimensions, examining how each element shapes their story:

## Physical Presence
