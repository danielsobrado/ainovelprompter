# Fantasy Writing Critique Prompt

Critique the following creative writing piece with a clear, professional editorial tone. Be **precise**, **unsentimental**, and **honest** in your analysis avoid any empty flattery. 

Structure your critique in three parts with the specified headings, using bullet points and quoted examples for clarity. Focus on providing sharp, constructive feedback and only genuine praise where truly deserved.

## 1. Objective Editorial Review

* **Story Analysis:** Evaluate the story’s overall **structure**, **clarity**, **pacing**, **worldbuilding**, and **character consistency**. Identify any sections that are **confusing**, **overly repetitive**, or **technically weak** in execution.
* **Issues & Suggestions:** For each problem area you find, **quote the specific sentence or passage** and then **explain why it doesn’t work**. Be specific about what is awkward or unclear. **Offer a detailed, practical suggestion** for rewriting or improving that example. (For instance, if dialogue is clunky or exposition heavy, show how it could be rewritten in a smoother, more engaging way.)

## 2. Ruthless Authorship Test

* **AI Warning Signs:** Scrutinize the text for any telltale **signs of AI-generated writing**: e.g. **vague or generic phrasing**, **clichéd descriptions**, **emotionally flat tone**, **unnecessary repetition or filler**, **logical inconsistencies**, or an overly **safe/sterile style**. Point out where the writing feels robotic or lazy.
* **Identify & Improve:** **Quote each line or phrase that comes off as artificial, bland, or overused**, then **call out why it’s problematic** (for example, maybe it’s a tired cliché, or it conveys no real feeling, or it breaks continuity/logic). After each quoted issue, **provide a sharper, more “human” alternative**, a rewritten version or tweak that injects personality, clarity, or vividness. This demonstrates how to fix the flat or generic parts to make them more engaging.

## 3. Selective Praise

* **Exceptional Highlights:** Identify only the lines or passages that are **truly exceptional** in quality, for instance, moments of stunning originality, strong emotional impact, or a beautifully distinctive style. **Quote each standout line or section** and clearly **explain what makes it so effective**. Be specific: does it use a fresh and vivid metaphor? Does it reveal deep emotion or insight? Is the dialogue especially sharp or the imagery immersive?
* **Genuine Approval:** Limit your praise **strictly** to these genuinely outstanding elements. **Avoid generic compliments** or any flattery about the rest of the work. By focusing only on the most powerful aspects, you’ll give honest validation to what the writer did well without sugar-coating the overall critique.

**Remember:** Your tone throughout should remain that of a **professional editor**, **clear, direct, and constructive**. The goal is to help refine the writing. Be thorough in your critique, **unsparing yet fair**, and always explain your reasoning. Each section of your response should be well-organized, using bullet points or numbered lists and including quoted examples from the text as evidence. This structured, no-nonsense approach will ensure a comprehensive evaluation that a writer can truly learn from.
