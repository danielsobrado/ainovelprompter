## Why AI-Generated Text Often Feels Robotic

Even as AI models become more advanced, their default writing style often has tell-tale signs of being machine-generated. Understanding these common issues is the first step toward fixing them:

- **Clichéd or Generic Intros:** AI content often opens with broad, filler phrases like “In today’s world…” or “With the rapid advancement of technology…” ([How to Spot AI-Generated Text: Common Words and Phrases That Give It Away | by Ava Thompson | Medium](https://medium.com/@avas3/how-to-spot-ai-generated-text-common-words-and-phrases-that-give-it-away-89124f83c50d#:~:text=1,Other%20Clich%C3%A9%20Openers)). These nonspecific openers add little value and sound formulaic. Humans tend to start with something more specific or attention-grabbing (a personal anecdote, a surprising fact, etc.) ([How to Spot AI-Generated Text: Common Words and Phrases That Give It Away | by Ava Thompson | Medium](https://medium.com/@avas3/how-to-spot-ai-generated-text-common-words-and-phrases-that-give-it-away-89124f83c50d#:~:text=How%20to%20Avoid%20It%3A%20When,the%20trap%20of%20vague%20generalizations)).  
- **Overused Transitions and Formal Connectors:** AI has a habit of linking every sentence with words like *Moreover*, *Furthermore*, *Additionally*, or *However*. While transitions are helpful in moderation, overusing them makes the text feel unnatural ([How to Spot AI-Generated Text: Common Words and Phrases That Give It Away | by Ava Thompson | Medium](https://medium.com/@avas3/how-to-spot-ai-generated-text-common-words-and-phrases-that-give-it-away-89124f83c50d#:~:text=AI%20models%20tend%20to%20overcompensate,heavy%20reliance%20on%20phrases%20like)). Human writers don’t begin *every* sentence with a heavy connector – they mix it up with simple sentences or implicit transitions ([How to Spot AI-Generated Text: Common Words and Phrases That Give It Away | by Ava Thompson | Medium](https://medium.com/@avas3/how-to-spot-ai-generated-text-common-words-and-phrases-that-give-it-away-89124f83c50d#:~:text=every%20single%20sentence%20to%20the,an%20overabundance%20of%20formal%20transitions)).  
- **Repetitive Sentence Structures:** Machine-generated text often sticks to a predictable rhythm, such as multiple sentences in a row following the same subject-verb-object pattern. For example, you might see several sentences in a row starting with “It is [important to note]…” or “This is because…” ([How to Spot AI-Generated Text: Common Words and Phrases That Give It Away | by Ava Thompson | Medium](https://medium.com/@avas3/how-to-spot-ai-generated-text-common-words-and-phrases-that-give-it-away-89124f83c50d#:~:text=AI%20tends%20to%20default%20to,follow%20this%20kind%20of%20rhythm)). This uniformity feels stiff. Humans naturally vary sentence length and structure; some sentences are short, others are longer and more complex ([Overused AI Words? How to Spot Them and Avoid Them Entirely](https://podcastle.ai/blog/overused-ai-words/#:~:text=Vary%20your%20sentence%20length)). This variation (often called **“burstiness”** in writing) keeps prose engaging.  
- **Filler and Fluff:** AI content might pad explanations with redundant phrases to reach a word count or to sound “complete.” Phrases like “It is clear that this is important because…” or “As we know, this has been happening for a long time…” add no real value ([How to Spot AI-Generated Text: Common Words and Phrases That Give It Away | by Ava Thompson | Medium](https://medium.com/@avas3/how-to-spot-ai-generated-text-common-words-and-phrases-that-give-it-away-89124f83c50d#:~:text=Another%20key%20giveaway%20of%20AI,For%20instance)). They make the text bloated and boring. Human writers usually trim unnecessary sentences and get to the point ([How to Spot AI-Generated Text: Common Words and Phrases That Give It Away | by Ava Thompson | Medium](https://medium.com/@avas3/how-to-spot-ai-generated-text-common-words-and-phrases-that-give-it-away-89124f83c50d#:~:text=How%20to%20Avoid%20It%3A%20Keep,tend%20to%20circle%20around%20points)).  
- **Lack of Emotional Depth or Voice:** AI is good at factual, neutral writing, but it often fails to convey genuine emotion, humor, or personality ([How to Spot AI-Generated Text: Common Words and Phrases That Give It Away | by Ava Thompson | Medium](https://medium.com/@avas3/how-to-spot-ai-generated-text-common-words-and-phrases-that-give-it-away-89124f83c50d#:~:text=AI%20struggles%20with%20subtlety,that%20human%20writing%20often%20carries)). The result can be a flat tone – informative but lifeless. Real human writing usually carries a voice or an emotional undertone. For instance, a human might inject enthusiasm, skepticism, or empathy into the text, whereas AI by default stays overly neutral ([How to Spot AI-Generated Text: Common Words and Phrases That Give It Away | by Ava Thompson | Medium](https://medium.com/@avas3/how-to-spot-ai-generated-text-common-words-and-phrases-that-give-it-away-89124f83c50d#:~:text=You%20may%20notice%3A)).  
- **Predictable Word Choices:** Because AI predicts likely words, it sometimes leans on common words or phrases over and over. It might also choose overly formal words (“utilize” instead of “use”) because they appear frequently in its training data. This can come across as pretentious or oddly polished ([5 Strategies to Make Your AI Written Text Completely Undetectable in 2024](https://felloai.com/2024/09/5-strategies-to-make-your-ai-written-text-completely-undetectable-in-2024/#:~:text=Large%20Language%20Models%20like%20ChatGPT,human%20would%20be%20more%20concise)). Human writers might opt for a mix of vocabulary – simple words where appropriate, but occasionally a colorful or less common term for flair ([My Prompt To Generate Original, Undetectable AI Content : r/ClaudeAI](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/18bbmnb/my_prompt_to_generate_original_undetectable_ai/#:~:text=When%20creating%20written%20content%2C%20artificial,Provide%20valuable%20information)). It’s this mix of the expected and unexpected (known as higher **“perplexity”** in text) that makes writing interesting ([How to Avoid an AI Detection False Positive - AI Detector](https://aidetector.com/blog/ai-detection-false-positive#:~:text=How%20to%20Avoid%20an%20AI,writing%20more%20interesting%20to%20read)).  

Understanding these issues – generic structure, overly formal language, lack of variation, missing emotion – guides us on what to **avoid** and **what to add** when crafting prompts for Claude.

## Strategies to Make AI Writing More Human-Like

To humanize AI-generated text, we need to deliberately introduce the variety, personality, and nuance that a human writer would naturally use. The following strategies are drawn from user experiences, writing experts, and research on AI/human text differences:

- **Use a Conversational Tone:** Instruct Claude to write **as if talking to a person**, not delivering a lecture. This means using first and second person (“I” and “you”) and casual phrasing when appropriate ([My Prompt To Generate Original, Undetectable AI Content : r/ClaudeAI](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/18bbmnb/my_prompt_to_generate_original_undetectable_ai/#:~:text=Break%20up%20long%20sentences,to%20link)) ([My Prompt To Generate Original, Undetectable AI Content : r/ClaudeAI](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/18bbmnb/my_prompt_to_generate_original_undetectable_ai/#:~:text=Use%20personal%20pronouns%20and%20speak,Use%20varied%20vocabulary)). Contractions are your friend – “don’t” instead of “do not,” “you’ve” instead of “you have” ([Mastering AI Writing for Authentic Human Tone | by Matthew Kress | Apr, 2025 | Medium](https://medium.com/@mjkress10/mastering-ai-writing-for-authentic-human-tone-f6f7618ad262#:~:text=E,Language)). If you wouldn’t say a phrase out loud in a real conversation, don’t use it in text ([Overused AI Words? How to Spot Them and Avoid Them Entirely](https://podcastle.ai/blog/overused-ai-words/#:~:text=Write%20like%20you%E2%80%99d%20speak%20,want%20to%20be%20spoken%20to)). For example, rather than “It is important to consider,” a more human version might be “You’ve gotta think about…” ([Mastering AI Writing for Authentic Human Tone | by Matthew Kress | Apr, 2025 | Medium](https://medium.com/@mjkress10/mastering-ai-writing-for-authentic-human-tone-f6f7618ad262#:~:text=E,Language)). This immediately makes the tone less stiff and more relatable.  
- **Vary Sentence Length and Structure (Boost “Burstiness”):** Intentionally mix short sentences with longer, complex ones to create a natural rhythm ([Overused AI Words? How to Spot Them and Avoid Them Entirely](https://podcastle.ai/blog/overused-ai-words/#:~:text=Vary%20your%20sentence%20length)) ([My Prompt To Generate Original, Undetectable AI Content : r/ClaudeAI](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/18bbmnb/my_prompt_to_generate_original_undetectable_ai/#:~:text=Two%20factors%20must%20always%20be,both%20perplexity%20and%20burstiness%20are)). Humans tend to do this unconsciously – a quick, punchy sentence might follow a longer descriptive one ([Overused AI Words? How to Spot Them and Avoid Them Entirely](https://podcastle.ai/blog/overused-ai-words/#:~:text=Vary%20your%20sentence%20length)). You can prompt Claude to ensure some sentences are brief and others more detailed. This variability (called **burstiness**) makes the text flow in a lively way, rather than each sentence marching in the same cadence. As one expert put it, *skilled writers know that a little more perplexity and burstiness makes writing more interesting to read* ([How to Avoid an AI Detection False Positive - AI Detector](https://aidetector.com/blog/ai-detection-false-positive#:~:text=How%20to%20Avoid%20an%20AI,writing%20more%20interesting%20to%20read)).  
- **Choose Less Predictable Words at Times (Increase “Perplexity”):** Along with varying sentence structure, you can ask Claude to occasionally use more creative or uncommon word choices (as long as meaning stays clear). Replacing a very common descriptor with a more vivid one can make a sentence stand out. For instance, instead of saying “very hungry,” a human might say “starving” or even use an idiom like “could eat a horse.” Such twists increase the text’s **perplexity** (complexity/unpredictability) and reduce the chance readers feel it’s formulaic ([My Prompt To Generate Original, Undetectable AI Content : r/ClaudeAI](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/18bbmnb/my_prompt_to_generate_original_undetectable_ai/#:~:text=Two%20factors%20must%20always%20be,both%20perplexity%20and%20burstiness%20are)). *Don’t always use the most natural (obvious) word* if a less usual synonym would add flavor ([ChatGPT 3.5 - How to Humanize content? | BlackHatWorld](https://www.blackhatworld.com/seo/chatgpt-3-5-how-to-humanize-content.1578175/#:~:text=,for%2C%20not%20only%2C%20seeking%20more)) – but do ensure it still sounds natural in context. (Be careful not to go overboard and make the text sound thesaurus-generated; balance is key.)  
- **Cut Out Filler, Clichés, and “AI Speak”:** In your prompt, explicitly tell Claude to **avoid empty phrases** and overused expressions. Many AI giveaways are phrases that sound stuffy or overly grandiose. For example, you can instruct: *“No ‘in the ever-evolving landscape of’ or ‘game-changer’ language,”* to prevent those tired clichés ([Overused AI Words? How to Spot Them and Avoid Them Entirely](https://podcastle.ai/blog/overused-ai-words/#:~:text=%E2%9C%85%20Instead%20of%3A%20%E2%80%9CWrite%20a,%E2%80%9D)). If Claude tends to add lines like “It is worth noting that…” or “As previously mentioned,” you can forbid those as well ([Mastering AI Writing for Authentic Human Tone | by Matthew Kress | Apr, 2025 | Medium](https://medium.com/@mjkress10/mastering-ai-writing-for-authentic-human-tone-f6f7618ad262#:~:text=D)). The idea is to **trim the fat** – every sentence should carry some weight or information. One user-tip is: *each sentence should provide value to the overall piece; if it doesn’t, remove or rewrite it* ([ChatGPT 3.5 - How to Humanize content? | BlackHatWorld](https://www.blackhatworld.com/seo/chatgpt-3-5-how-to-humanize-content.1578175/#:~:text=straightforward%20sentences.%20,Strictly%20follow%20this%20guideline)). By eliminating fluff, the content becomes more direct and authentic ([Overused AI Words? How to Spot Them and Avoid Them Entirely](https://podcastle.ai/blog/overused-ai-words/#:~:text=Cut%20the%20yappy%20fluff)).  
- **Inject Personality, Emotion, and Empathy:** Don’t be afraid to **add a human voice** in the content. You can instruct Claude to adopt a tone that matches an emotional state or personal perspective appropriate for the task. For example, *“Write with a tone of genuine excitement and a hint of humor,”* or *“Sound empathetic and understanding, as if you’ve been through this too.”* AI text often lacks these touches, so prompts that encourage expressions of feeling make a huge difference ([How to Spot AI-Generated Text: Common Words and Phrases That Give It Away | by Ava Thompson | Medium](https://medium.com/@avas3/how-to-spot-ai-generated-text-common-words-and-phrases-that-give-it-away-89124f83c50d#:~:text=You%20may%20notice%3A)) ([ChatGPT 3.5 - How to Humanize content? | BlackHatWorld](https://www.blackhatworld.com/seo/chatgpt-3-5-how-to-humanize-content.1578175/#:~:text=,)). This could mean acknowledging uncertainties (“I have to admit, I’m not entirely sure…”), showing excitement (“I was absolutely thrilled when…”), or empathy (“I know how frustrating it can be when…”). In a **friendly email**, a human might say “I’m really happy you reached out!” or “I understand where you’re coming from” – such phrases make the writing warmer and more convincing as human.  
- **Use Idioms and Colloquialisms (Appropriately):** **Idioms, slang, and colloquial expressions** are a hallmark of natural human language. Phrases like “break the ice,” “hit the nail on the head,” or even mild slang like “kudos to you” can make writing feel less like a machine and more like a person talking. When suitable for the context and audience, prompt Claude to *sprinkle in idiomatic expressions or casual slang* ([My Prompt To Generate Original, Undetectable AI Content : r/ClaudeAI](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/18bbmnb/my_prompt_to_generate_original_undetectable_ai/#:~:text=Be%20concise,polishing%20until%20it%20flows%20naturally)). For example, for a Gen Z audience you might allow a phrase like “this snack slaps” (if it fits the tone). For a corporate audience, maybe something like “get the ball rolling” – common idioms that a professional might still use in conversation. **Important**: Don’t overuse slang or idioms to the point of cliché, and make sure they fit the voice of the piece. One or two well-placed colloquial phrases can add warmth, but too many can seem forced ([My Prompt To Generate Original, Undetectable AI Content : r/ClaudeAI](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/18bbmnb/my_prompt_to_generate_original_undetectable_ai/#:~:text=Be%20concise,polishing%20until%20it%20flows%20naturally)).  
- **“Show, Don’t Tell”:** This classic writing advice means **illustrating ideas with examples or sensory details** rather than just stating them plainly. AI outputs often “tell” a lot of facts or general statements without concrete examples. You can prompt Claude to include anecdotes, mini-stories, or metaphors that **show** the point ([Mastering AI Writing for Authentic Human Tone | by Matthew Kress | Apr, 2025 | Medium](https://medium.com/@mjkress10/mastering-ai-writing-for-authentic-human-tone-f6f7618ad262#:~:text=A)). For instance, instead of a dry statement like “Collaboration is important in teams,” a more human approach might be: “Remember that project where Sales and Engineering actually sat down together? That little experiment ended up sparking our best idea of the year – a pretty good reminder of how powerful real collaboration can be.” Here, a brief anecdote or scenario *shows* the value of collaboration in a relatable way. Claude can be guided to produce such examples by instructions like *“Include a personal story or hypothetical example to illustrate this.”* This not only makes the content feel original but also engages readers on a personal level ([Mastering AI Writing for Authentic Human Tone | by Matthew Kress | Apr, 2025 | Medium](https://medium.com/@mjkress10/mastering-ai-writing-for-authentic-human-tone-f6f7618ad262#:~:text=,Here%E2%80%99s%20how%20I%20fixed%20it%E2%80%A6%E2%80%9D)).  
- **Allow a Bit of Imperfection:** Human writing isn’t flawlessly polished – and ironically, that’s part of what makes it feel real. People sometimes start sentences with “And” or “But.” We use fragments for effect. We even make the occasional minor grammar slip or have a less-than-perfect sentence. While you don’t want to fill your text with errors, you *can* tell Claude it’s okay to be a little **informal or imperfect** in service of a natural tone ([Mastering AI Writing for Authentic Human Tone | by Matthew Kress | Apr, 2025 | Medium](https://medium.com/@mjkress10/mastering-ai-writing-for-authentic-human-tone-f6f7618ad262#:~:text=D)). For example, using an ellipsis “…” to indicate a pause or an unfinished thought can mimic human hesitation (“I’m not sure… maybe we should double-check that.”). Or you might instruct: *“It’s fine to begin a sentence with ‘And’ if it makes the flow more natural,”* which breaks a formal rule but is very common in casual writing. These deliberate imperfections – like a sentence fragment for emphasis (“A huge mistake, in hindsight.”) – can make the prose more **stylish and genuine** ([Mastering AI Writing for Authentic Human Tone | by Matthew Kress | Apr, 2025 | Medium](https://medium.com/@mjkress10/mastering-ai-writing-for-authentic-human-tone-f6f7618ad262#:~:text=D)). Just use them sparingly and purposefully. The key is *controlled* informality: we’re adding a human touch, not making the text sloppy.
